<p>Having been often solicited, by my friends, to publish
an account of my travels and labors in the West,
after much hesitation and doubt, I have concluded to
accede to their wishes. But before doing so, I will
say a little about my early life. Newburyport, Mass.,
is my native place. My father, whose full name I
bear, was from Denmark; my mother from Amsterdam,
Holland. I was the first born of a family of
three boys, one of whom, Frederick, many years since
passed the way of all the earth. The other, James,
resides in Texas. My father was a sailor, and was
lost at sea in a terrific storm, when I was seven years
old. I have a faint recollection of seeing him two or
three times, and the only memento I have of him, is
a large pitcher he had manufactured in Liverpool
with his name and the picture of a ship on one side,
and my mother’s maiden name and a picture representing
Liberty, Peace and Independence, on the opposite<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
side. My mother was left in indigent circumstances,
with not a relative in the New World, save
her three helpless boys. She married some years
after my father’s death, and resided till her death,
which took place two years since, in Princeton, Mass.
I have then a father, mother and one brother on the
other side of the river, and one brother on this side,
and not many years can elapse ere the whole family
will be reunited in the land beyond the flood. I well
remember the spot where all of us once lived, although
I have not been in Newburyport for thirty years. It
was on High street, between the Court House and the
residence of “Lord” Timothy Dexter. To me, that
street seemed a paradise, and it was, and still is, a
magnificent thoroughfare. It is on high ground, runs
parallel with the Merrimac river, overlooks the harbor,
and is bordered with rows of grand trees, with
fine residences embowered in lawns and flower gardens.
In this charming locality, I spent the first decade
of my life. Here I ran, played, and frolicked
with my brothers, and other little associates. The
Mall around the Court House, the pond in the rear,
and a neighboring cemetery, were places of frequent
resort. On Sunday, I attended Dr. Morse’s church,
where, I am told, I was christened by the good doctor,
who was an Episcopalian. But the bud came
near being suddenly blasted. An old-fashioned cent
which I put into my mouth, slipped down my throat,
and was extracted with much difficulty. I distinctly
remember the circumstance. When the copper was
taken out, blood flowed copiously from my mouth.
My poor mother was much frightened, and I suffered
for a short time severely. If my father had lived, I
should probably have been a sailor. He was first
mate of the ship in which he made his last and fatal
voyage, and was to have been promoted to captain on
his return. I have ever loved the sea, and a ship is
a thing of beauty in my eye. But it was written<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
that the solid earth, not the treacherous deep, should
be the field of my operations.</p>

<p>One word about Lord Timothy, just referred to.
He was a very eccentric man, had many soft spots on
his head, but knew enough to accumulate a large fortune.
He built a magnificent residence, which he
adorned in a very extravagant manner, with sculpture
and pictures. He was very vain of his house
and wealth. It is said that a stranger, passing his
house, was attentively observing it, when Dexter,
who was sitting at a window, remarked: “Do you
not think this is paradise?” “I should,” replied the
man, “if I did not see the devil at the window.”
He was dubbed “Lord” for his vanity and ostentation,
and the title delighted him as much as “Corsica”
prefixed to Boswell, delighted the well known
biographer of that name.</p>

<p>I commenced attending school at an early age, but
have no pleasant memories of school-hours in my
native town. My teacher would read a chapter in
the Bible, and make a long prayer every morning,
and then whip and pound his pupils till the time for
his evening devotions. If I escaped a day without
two or three hard thrashings, I deemed myself very
fortunate, and I think I was as dutiful as school boys
generally were of my age. He was doubtless a believer
in total depravity, and was sure that nothing
but blows and knocks would make a good impression
on our corrupt hearts.</p>

<p>From my tenth to my eighteenth year, I resided in
Haverhill, Mass., with S. George. He was a farmer
and shoemaker—made shoes in the winter, and tilled
the soil summers, and I worked on his farm and in
his shop, except winters, when I attended school. I
remember my first attempt at horseback riding. I
went to live with him in the spring, and he soon put
me on a horse to ride when ploughing corn. The
beast was contrary and spirited. He would go like<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
jehu a few rods, and then stop short, and I would go
over his head on to the ground. But I was as
spunky as the horse, and would scramble up, and tell
Mr. G. to put me on again. I was always eager to
remount the beast, although he threw me twenty times
a day. Since then, I have rode over the Western country
horseback, and consider myself a good horseman.</p>

<p>I have said I worked in Mr. G.’s shoe shop; yes,
and learned to make cheap shoes, but always despised
the business, and never more than half learned the
trade. My aspiration was to be a <em>merchant</em>. Oh, if
I could only be a merchant how happy I would be!
I dreamed, and planned, and built air-castles—would
weep over my “lapstone,” for being doomed to work
at that hateful trade. When I was about sixteen
years old, the Boston <cite>Trumpet</cite>, a Universalist paper,
published by Thomas Whittemore, led me to look
into Universalism, for up to that time I knew nothing
of its principles or history. Mr. George’s family, and
all my associates, attended the Congregational church
in the neighborhood, and no body seemed to call in
question the infallibility of the sermons we heard
every Sunday. But the <cite>Trumpet</cite> opened a new
world to my view, changed all my aspirations, and I
was really born again. I thought no more of being a
merchant—that seemed a contemptible calling,—but
must be a <em>preacher</em>. I devoured the paper, read the
Bible, and had many hard fought battles with my
comrades. I loved them, loved the world, and was
sure, if I could get the ears of mankind, I could convert
all nations and people. The world seemed to be
a musical instrument, tuning the praises of its
almighty Author. Thomas Farnsworth was then
preaching in Haverhill, four miles from where I
resided, and I called on him several times, and he
urged me to prepare for the ministry, but I never
intimated to him that I had such an intention. I
kept that to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>I was always fond of reading, and my new faith
quickened my love for it. I perused religious books,
romance, history, but poetry was especially my delight.
I remember with what enthusiasm I read
portions of Dr. Young’s “Night Thoughts.” His
grand and solemn thoughts and diction stirred my
soul to its lowest depths. I even wrote what I called
“poetry,” but I am thankful that none of it survives.
I have never attempted the “divine art” since those
early days, although phrenologists tell me I <em>ought</em> to
be something of a poet, as my “ideality” is large.</p>

<p>When in Haverhill, I came near losing my life. I
never could swim, but with a plank three feet long,
one end pressing against my body, I could paddle far
from shore into deep water, without any fear. On
one occasion, when indulging in one of my aqueous
excursions, while in deep water, a comrade, who
was ignorant of my helpless condition when off the
plank, took it from me, when down I went, but by
the aid of other boys I reached the shore, and I
never went into deep water again on my frail craft.
In my boyhood, I was subject to violent attacks of
colic and sick headache, but otherwise my health was
good. My physical frame was small and of fine texture,
and consequently I was not very strong, and
could not cope with boys generally of my age in
athletic exercises.</p>

<p>When I was eighteen years old, I left old Haverhill,
and repaired to Princeton, where I attended
school one year, and made considerable progress in
English branches. But my purse being nearly empty,
I was obliged to replenish it before I could further
prosecute my studies; and having no one to aid
me, I went to Boston, hoping something would there
turn up in my favor. I knew no one in that city,
and no one knew me, and soon became satisfied I had
better try my fortune elsewhere. I noticed in a city
paper, that school teachers were wanted in Eastern<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
New York, and I resolved to go there and seek a
school, although I had only three dollars in my pocket,
and it was one hundred and eighty miles to the
place of destination; but my empty purse did not prevent
my making the journey. On foot and alone, I
traveled the whole distance. Although my feet were
sore, and my bones and muscles ached, I pursued my
weary march, and finally reached the neighborhood
of Bethlehem—I think that was the name of the
place. I found myself in the midst of a German settlement,
with a people of unknown tongue, and of
manners and customs all new to me. I remained
there but a few days, became distressingly homesick,
and resolved to return to Boston. Repaired to Albany,
where I sold my watch to pay traveling expenses,
went on a steamboat to New-York city, and from
thence to Boston by sea. This was my first tour;
this was the beginning of my ramblings, but it was
rather an unpropitious beginning. When I went on
this school-hunting expedition, my intention was,
after securing a school, to devote my leisure hours to
study, and if opportunity offered, to speak occasionally
in public, and thereby prepare myself for what I
deemed the chief business of my life. But that
Dutch Bethlehem broke up all my calculations, and I
returned disgusted, but not discouraged.</p>

<p>In a few days I walked out to Lynn, the great shoe
manufacturing town of New England, where nearly
all the men, women and children are shoemakers, and
recommenced cobbling, earning enough to defray current
expenses, and continued my studies. J. C. Waldo
was then pastor of the Universalist church in
Lynn, and I soon introduced myself to him, and
made known my intentions of preparing for the ministry,
and he kindly offered me the use of his books,
and such instruction as I might need in prosecuting
my object. I remained in L. six months, working,
reading and writing, when Mr. Waldo advised me to<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
go to Malden, and study with Sylvanus Cobb. To
Malden I repaired, and made arrangements with Mr.
C. to reside in his family, and devote all my time to
study.</p>

<p>A new era in my life had now opened, and my
hopes were buoyant. I could give all my time and
thought to study, and I made the best use of my
advantages. Mr. Cobb was a prominent man in the
denomination, an able minister, a fair scholar, and
consequently well qualified to give instruction. To
that excellent man, and his accomplished lady, I am
under great and lasting obligations. “I was a
stranger and they took me in.” May God ever bless
them. They now reside in Boston. Mr. Cobb, or
rather, Dr. Cobb, for he is now a D. D., for many
years published the <cite>Christian Freeman</cite>, is the author
of a Commentary on the New Testament, and of several
other useful books. His son, Sylvanus Cobb, Jr.,
who is a well known literary writer, was a boy when
I was in Mr. C.’s family, and the twins, Cyrus and
Darius, now ministers, and who fought for the Stars
and Stripes, during the late rebellion, were born
while I was a member of the household. He had
three other students while I was with him—A. P.
Cleverly, G. Hastings, and C. S. Hussey. We had
fine times; we talked, read, wrote and declaimed.
When we wanted to ventilate our logic, we repaired
to a neighboring grove, where we made the welkin
ring with our eloquence. “The Orthodox,” said A.
P. Cleverly, on one of these occasions, “will come to
you with their creed in one hand, and damnation in
the other, and say to you, take <em>this</em> or take <em>that</em>, but
one of them you must and shall have.” On Monday
we generally went to Boston, two miles distant, and
at the <cite>Trumpet</cite> office would usually see Hosea Ballou,
H. Ballou, 2d, Walter Balfour, Thomas Whittemore,
Sabastian Streeter, Henry Bacon, T. B. Thayer, all
noted men, but most of them are now dwellers of the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
spirit land. The departed did a noble work on earth,
and long will they be remembered. “Blessed are
the dead that die in the Lord.”</p>

<p>When I had been with Mr. Cobb about three
months, he went to the state of Maine, and left me
to preach for him one Sabbath. My heart jumped
when the first bell on Sunday morning told me to
prepare for my first pulpit services; but I went
through the exercises of the day without much embarrassment.
My texts were: “God is love”—“They
hated me without a cause.” When Mr. C.
returned, he seemed well satisfied with my effort, for
he had heard his friends speak of it, and gave me
words of encouragement. While with him, I preached
in Lynn, Haverhill, and several other places, but
devoted most of my time to hard study.</p>

<p>After being with Mr. Cobb six months, I put myself
under the instruction of William S. Balch, then
residing in Claremont, N. H., and pastor of the church
in that place. I found him to be a noble man and
shall ever remember his many acts of kindness with
gratitude. Although I was in his family, and received
his instruction most of the time during six months,
he would receive no compensation. He now resides
in Galesburg, Ill., and although years are pressing
hard upon him, he is as faithful in the discharge of
his ministerial duties as when in early manhood.
When with him, I took my <em>first preaching tour</em>, and
had my <em>first debate</em>. I went up the Connecticut river
into Canada, and preached in most of the towns on
both sides of the river. I performed the journey on
foot, and must have walked about two hundred miles.
In one town where I had an appointment, a Methodist
minister had one at the same place and hour.
We both met in the pulpit. He did not wish to
speak, as he was unwell, he said, and desired me to
occupy the time. I objected, for I was afraid of him;
but as he insisted that I should go ahead, I delivered<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
my discourse. My text was: “For if the word spoken
by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense of reward,
how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation
which at the first was spoken by the Lord, and confirmed
unto us by them that heard him.” Heb. ii. 2,
3. As soon as I was through, he seemed to be well
enough, took my text, and made a long reply to my
feeble effort. He handled me rather rough, but I did
the best I could in the way of a rejoinder, but felt that
I had come out <em>second</em> best. It was not manly in him,
an experienced preacher, to attack a boy as he did; but
I suppose he had rather encounter a boy than a man.</p>

<p>Soon after returning from this journey, I noticed a
statement by Otis A. Skinner, a minister in Baltimore,
Md., in one of our denominational papers, that
several young men were wanted to preach in Maryland,
and Mr. Balch advised me to go there. Heeding
his advice, I went by stage across the Green
Mountains to Albany, thence to New-York. In the
latter place, I had the following conversation with
an Englishman, right from his foggy island:</p>

<p>“I do not like this country,” said he.</p>

<p>“Why not?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I have many reasons. One is, the people are not
refined enough. I did not encounter as much coarseness
during the thirty years I lived in England, as I
have in this country the past six months.”</p>

<p>“You have been very unfortunate in the company
you have kept. There are coarse people in all countries,
and a man can eat and sleep with them all his
lifetime if he chooses. But that there are more coarse
people in this country than in England, I am sure is
an error. But what do you mean by coarseness?”</p>

<p>“I mean that the <em>peasants</em> do not pay proper
respect to <em>gentlemen</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I understand you. Why, sir, we have
no <em>peasants</em> in this country; <em>all are gentlemen</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“I abhor such a democratic notion. Only see how
rudely your people talk about the President of the
United States. He is called Mr. Jackson, Old Jackson,
Old Hickory. In Europe, we call the king, His
Majesty. Don’t you see the difference?”</p>

<p>“I see the difference. The people of this country
have little respect for titles, and I am thankful for it;
but they have great respect for <em>man</em>; so much that
they deem every man a sovereign; and I hope they
will never make such fools of themselves as to single
out one of their number, perhaps the biggest gump
in the land, and bow down and worship him, and like
cringing slaves, call him ‘His Majesty.’ God only is
worthy the title of Majesty.”</p>

<p>In the cars near Baltimore, I had some conversation
with a lawyer, concerning slavery.</p>

<p>“Are you going South?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“To Maryland. Am from the East, and was never
as far south or west before.”</p>

<p>“As you are going into a slave-holding state, I
should like to know your views of slavery.”</p>

<p>“In principle I think it is wrong; but I know little
of its practical effects. I shall be better able to
judge of it practically at some future time.”</p>

<p>“Morally I regard it wrong; nearly all the Southern
people so view it. But that slavery is a benefit
to the blacks, there can be no doubt. As an evidence
of this, contrast the condition of the negroes in Africa
with their condition in the Southern states. In this
country they are far better off than their brethren are
in Africa.”</p>

<p>“They doubtless are in some respects, but I am
not sure that slavery has improved them. Living in
this country, and associating, to some extent, with a
superior race, has improved them; but I cannot admit
that slavery has done it. You admit slavery to be an
evil, and we have the best authority for asserting,
that an evil tree cannot produce good fruit. It seems<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
to me that you condemn slavery in <em>principle</em> and
<em>practice</em> when you admit it to be an evil. What
effect do you think it has on the whites?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly a beneficial effect. There is more
refinement and high-toned character in the slave
states than in the free states. The people in the
South have leisure to cultivate the better sentiments
of their nature.”</p>

<p>“I repeat, you must be mistaken. If slavery is a
upas tree—is an evil as you admit—it cannot produce
such heavenly fruit. It is not true that the Southern
people are more intelligent, moral and refined than
the Eastern people. Statistics, from which there can
be no appeal, show that there are more school houses,
academies, colleges and meeting houses in the East,
than in the South, in proportion to the population.
There are more persons in Virginia, the best of the
slave states, who cannot read or write, than there are
in six of the most Eastern states. Facts are against
you.”</p>

<p>I proceeded to Baltimore, and S. P. Skinner, who
afterwards resided, preached and published the <cite>New
Covenant</cite>, in Chicago, advised me to go to the eastern
shore of Maryland. This portion of the state, and
part of Delaware, lies between the Chesapeake and
Delaware bays. Most of this neck of land is level
and sandy, having been, at a comparatively recent
period, reclaimed from the sea. Went in a small vessel
to Centerville. While running down, I had some
conversation, on religious subjects, with an Episcopal
clergyman.</p>

<p>“The doctrine of endless punishment is taught in
the Old Testament.”</p>

<p>“That is your opinion, but some of the wisest and
most learned men of your school differ from you. I
will read some extracts from their writings on this
subject. Your Bishop Warburton, in his Divine Legation
of Moses, says:—‘In the Jewish Republic,<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
both the rewards and punishments promised by heaven
were temporal only. Such as health, long life, peace,
plenty, and dominion, etc. Disease, premature death,
war, famine, want, subjections, and captivity, etc.
And in no one place in the Mosaic Institutes is there
the least mention, or any intelligible hint, of the rewards
and punishments of another life.’</p>

<p>“Milman, in his History of the Jews, testifies thus:—‘The
sanction on which the Hebrew Law was
founded is extraordinary. The lawgiver (Moses)
maintains a profound silence on that fundamental
article, if not of political, at least of religious legislation—rewards
and punishments in another life. He
substituted temporal chastisements and temporal blessings.
On the violation of the constitution followed
inevitably blighted harvests, famine, pestilence, defeat,
captivity; on its maintenance, abundance, health,
fruitfulness, victory, independence. How wonderfully
the event verified the prediction of the inspired
legislator! how invariably apostasy led to adversity—repentance
and reformation to prosperity!’</p>

<p>“Dr. Paley, another great man of your church, admits
the same:—‘This (Mosaic) dispensation dealt in
temporal rewards and punishments. In the 28th of
Deuteronomy you find Moses, with prodigious solemnity,
pronouncing the blessings and cursings which
awaited the children of Israel under the dispensation
to which they were called. And you will observe,
that these blessings consisted <em>altogether</em> of worldly
benefits, and these curses of worldly punishments.’</p>

<p>“Jahn, the best of authority says:—‘We have not
authority, therefore, decidedly to say, that any other
motives were held out to the ancient Hebrews to
pursue good and avoid evil, than those which were
derived from the rewards and punishments of this
life.’</p>

<p>“This is the testimony of able and learned men
who have made the Bible their life-study. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
they believed in eternal woe, they candidly
admit that it is not taught by the great Lawgiver,
Moses, or the prophets.”</p>

<p>“They do seem to think that doctrine is not taught
in the Old Testament, and I admit their judgment is
entitled to much respect. I will look into the subject.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you express such a purpose.
And I am sure that you will agree with those wise
men, after a careful examination. If they are correct,
and the dogma in question is true, is it not amusing
that the Old Testament writers say nothing about
it? If they had believed in eternal punishment, they
surely would have spoken of it in distinct terms, and
warned their countrymen of their danger. You believe
in ceaseless woe, and you preach it faithfully,
earnestly. You are right; you act according to your
convictions. And were Moses and the prophets less
faithful and earnest? But they did not speak of it,
and the inference is, they had no faith in the doctrine.
But, sir, if that dogma is true, would not God have
<em>forced</em> those inspired men to proclaim it to a dying
world? Would God have permitted the Jews to be
ignorant of so important a matter? What! thousands
of immortal spirits daily dropping into a fiery
gulf, and not a word of warning given? have no intimation
of such a place till they find themselves in its
fathomless vortex? Believe this who can, I cannot.”</p>

<p>I spent six months in this part of Maryland, traveling
and preaching all the time. My head-quarters
were at Salisbury, and from thence I went east, west,
north and south, sometimes on foot, and sometimes
on horseback. The liberal faith I advocated was
almost totally unknown in that region. O. A. Skinner,
who had resided in Baltimore, once traveled
through there, and delivered a few discourses, but I
found not more than a dozen persons, who knew or
cared any thing about liberal christian sentiments.<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
It was any thing but a favorable field for one so
young and inexperienced as I was, to operate in. I
was tired of traveling, and desired to settle where I
could devote my time to two or three places, that I
might have an opportunity to study, for I well knew
my literary needs, and as such arrangements could
not be effected in that region, I resolved to try some
other locality. That my well intended labors had
much effect, is more than I can affirm, as I have
heard but little of the religious sentiments of the
people since I left there. Much of the Eastern Shore
is a very poor country, and were it not for the fish
and oysters that abound in Chesapeake bay, part of
that region would be an uninhabited desert, at least,
till the soil was improved, for the farmers in those
days merely scratched over the ground, and exhausted
it more and more every year. Slave labor and
<em>scratch culture</em>, I have observed, generally go together.
And, I think it is a fact, that poor soil, unless
there are counteracting causes, such as commerce and
manufacturing, produces weak heads and sterile
hearts; and it is also a fact, that the rich sentiments
of our faith will not flourish permanently in physical
or moral deserts. The apostles of our Lord spread
the gospel among the ignorant and brutal nations of
the earth, but how soon was it corrupted. Their
“darkness comprehended it not,” and there was soon
developed a wretched compound of light and darkness,
error and truth, sin and virtue, life and death,
heaven and hell, and this compound corresponded
with the intellectual and moral culture of the people.
Since Luther’s day, the process of disintegration has
been going on, and it will, I trust, continue till the
dross shall be all separated from the gold, and the
former burned with unquenchable fire.</p>

<p>I returned to Baltimore in December, 1836. Encountered
a terrific storm on the Bay, which came
near sending the vessel and all on board to the bottom.<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
It raged during a bitter cold night, the wind
was directly ahead, and most every wave swept the
deck fore and aft. The owner was on board, the
steersman was his negro slave, and he stood to his
post like a man the whole of that boisterous and cold
night. In the morning we anchored in a sheltered
situation, and during the day reached Baltimore.
Spent several weeks traveling and preaching in the
vicinity of the city, and from thence went to Hagerstown,
Md., which I made my home for six months.
Samuel A. Davis had labored in the vicinity some
time previous, as a missionary, but receiving little
encouragement, had moved to Pittsburg, Pa. I
preached in Hagerstown, Woodville, Frederick,
Sharpsburg, and many other places, in many of which
I was the first to proclaim our beautiful faith, and
encountered all sorts of opposition. Our ministers
who have always labored where our cause is well
established, have no idea of the mean and contemptible
opposition a laborer encounters in a new field,
where hardly any one knows any thing of our faith
or its history. At the close of a sermon I delivered
in Frederick, a clergyman of the place, arose and
poured forth the vials of his wrath. He said Universalism
was the lowest grade of infidelity, that the
blasphemies of Tom Paine were purity itself compared
to it; and that Universalists were the scum of
society, that the grog-shops, gambling dens, jails and
penitentiaries were full of them. Hosea Ballou and
Walter Balfour died drunkards, and they were the
best men the sect ever had. The fellow overshot the
mark, and disgusted the people with himself; and the
mild remarks I made after he got through, turned the
tide in my favor. Ever after, I had large congregations
in Frederick.</p>

<p>I spoke several times in Charleston, Va., where
John Brown was hung; also in Harper’s Ferry, the
place he so easily captured, and in Winchester, where<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
several battles, during the late rebellion, were
fought. In Smithfield, Va., I had an exciting season.
Went there an entire stranger, and delivered a discourse
in a school-house, the first sermon on the great
salvation ever delivered in the place. As soon as I
said amen, up jumped three men to reply. It was
with difficulty they agreed on which should first
speak. They finally settled that matter, and then
gave me particular attention. Each of them occupied
about half an hour, and as the night was short, for it
was an evening meeting, it was midnight when they
got through. I notified the people that I would
notice the arguments of the speakers the next evening.
The novelty of my faith, and the attention I
received from three of the most prominent men of
the town, caused intense excitement, and the whole
village, and the region round about, attended the
next meeting. My three opponents, one doctor and
two lawyers, were on hand, with paper and pencil,
which was ominous of another attack. I noticed the
arguments and proofs of the gentlemen, and replied
to them in the best way I could. One of them had
charged me with denying a judgment day. I stated
that I believed in a judgment day, yea, in many judgment
days. The Bible speaks of numerous judgment
days, but they are all <em>this side</em> of the end of the
world. When Adam and Eve were condemned and
driven out of Eden’s bowers, it was a judgment day
to them. When Cain was banished to the land of
Nod, it was his judgment day. When the wrath of
heaven burst on the world and destroyed all but
Noah’s family, it was a terrible judgment day. The
Sodomites experienced the horrors of a judgment day
when they were destroyed by fire. The ten tribes of
Israel, when they were banished to the far East,
never to return, knew something of a day of judgment.
When Babylon, Nineveh, and other mighty
cities of the old world were destroyed, they suffered<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
the desolations of judgment days. When Jerusalem
was trodden under foot by the Babylonian power,
and when subsequently it was burned up, ploughed
up, and drenched with the blood of its citizens, did it
not suffer, what the sacred writers call, days of
darkness, of gloom, of judgment? The world has
been crowded with judgment days: all nations and
people have sadly experienced their sorrows. The
Christian dispensation is also termed a day of judgment.
It commenced when the kingdom of God was
established on earth by the Son of the Highest, and
will continue, till Jesus shall return the kingdom to
God the Father, as recorded in 1st Corinthians 15th
chapter, when God shall be <em>all in all</em>. It commenced
amid sin, error, suffering and death, and when it shall
end those evils will be known no more, but truth,
virtue, life and immortality will be the universal and
everlasting boon of Adam’s race.</p>

<p>As soon as I got through, a lawyer commenced
reading a long chapter of quotations from the Bible,
to prove that there was a <em>devil</em>. He had prepared it
with much care, and read it loud and emphatically.
It was supposed that a preacher or two in town
helped him to his texts, and comments. When he
closed, a doctor commenced an harangue, but I begged
him to hold on till I had disposed of his brother’s
sermon. I told the people that I believed in <em>many
devils</em>—lying, slanderous, revengeful, cruel, superstitious,
sectarian devils; that every man was his own
devil, and if any of my hearers should become vile
and degraded, if they would look into a mirror, they
would see a devil. But I had no faith in the devil
the lawyer had been preaching about. As soon as I
had finished my remarks, the doctor resumed his
speech. He launched into the parable of the Rich
Man and Lazarus, and did a large amount of special
pleading, to show that the hell spoken of in that passage
was a place of eternal woe. When he was<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
through, I asked him if he would answer a few questions.
He replied that he would.</p>

<p>“Do you regard that passage to be a literal relation
of <em>facts</em>?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Hell is there called a <em>place</em>. Do you suppose it is
a place having length, width and height?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It is said to contain <em>fire</em>. Do you believe it contains
fire?”</p>

<p>“I do, for the passage says so.”</p>

<p>“The rich man and Lazarus were within <em>speaking
distance</em> of each other—they talked together. Do
you think that heaven and hell are so near each other,
that the saved can see the damned, and hear their
groans and lamentations?”</p>

<p>“I am not bound to answer that question.”</p>

<p>“But you promised to answer my questions.”</p>

<p>Several voices—“You must answer”—“You are
getting into a tight place.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I must answer it, I will say, Yes.”</p>

<p>“One more question. Could you be happy in
heaven if you should see all the dear ones you now
love, roasting in hell? Will you answer?”</p>

<p>“To be candid, I do not see how I could be
happy.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your candor. According to your
interpretation of the passage, and it is the common
interpretation, heaven and hell, the latter a region of
quenchless fire, are <em>neighbors</em>, within <em>speaking distance
of each other</em>, and mankind are to be torn asunder—part
driven into hell, and part sent to heaven—husbands
and wives divided, parents and children, brothers
and sisters divided, part in heaven and part in
hell, and those in heaven will know that half of the
world are in hell, that their near and dear friends are
there. Now, it is utterly impossible for there to be
any happiness in heaven, when such a world of woe<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
is within sight and hearing. The passage must be a
parable—figurative language. Jesus often spake in
parables. It is in connection with several parables,
and like them is figurative. But I have not time this
evening to give an explanation of it, but on to-morrow,
Sunday, at eleven o’clock, will give what I
regard to be the true exposition of that important passage.”</p>

<p>The discussion had a sensible effect on the hearers;
some rejoiced and some were mad. One old gentleman,
with streaming eyes, thanked me for what he
had heard. But others were so enraged, that some
of my friends feared that violent hands would be laid
on me, ere I should reach the hotel, and I heard several
cry, “Search his saddle-bags! he is a d——d
abolitionist! get a rail!”</p>

<p>The next day my meeting was in a grove, for no
house, that could be obtained, would hold half of the
people who came out. My youth, the novelty of my
faith, and the controversy, drew an immense concourse.
The people listened with attention and
respect, and the meeting was not disturbed by any
opposition. I went to the village a stranger to all,
but when I left, which was the next day, I had many
friends.</p>

<p>I often preached in Harpers Ferry, and generally
had large congregations. The town site, and its surroundings,
are well known to be remarkably picturesque.
The Shenandoah and Potomac, rapid
streams, here unite, and roar and plunge through
the chasm they have made through the Blue Ridge.
The rocks on both sides are several hundred feet
high, and nearly perpendicular. Thomas Jefferson
said it was worth a voyage across the Atlantic to see
this wonderful work of nature.</p>

<p>Near Hagerstown, I had a little controversy with a
Campbellite preacher. We both had an appointment
in a <em>barn</em>, and the people were eager to hear both of<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
us speak. He delivered a discourse on his peculiar
views—dwelt long on the importance of water baptism,
which he affirmed was a condition of salvation.
In my discourse, I paid particular attention to his
water-cure notions, and showed that if he was correct,
none could be saved without being baptized in water,
and therefore most of mankind would be lost forever,
as but a small portion of our race are immersed. In
his reply he said he did not believe in endless misery,
but in <em>annihilation</em>, and admitted that he had no evidence
of the salvation of a soul, old or young, in a
christian or a heathen land, without water baptism.
What a gospel! I rejoined. Instead of bringing life
and immortality to light, it proclaims <em>eternal death</em>
to nearly the whole world; instead of being good
news to our race, it is a howl of everlasting despair;
instead of being a blessing to the world, it is an unmitigated
curse; instead of its proclaiming that God
is the loving Father of mankind, it announces that
He is full of partiality and hatred towards most of His
creatures. Never again prostitute that blessed word,
gospel, by calling your partial, cruel and revengeful
system by that dear name. There is not as much
gospel in your creed as there is brain in a mosquito’s
head.</p>

<p>One evening, I accompanied a friend to a Methodist
meeting; the congregation was large, and a “revival”
was raging in its midst. The first speaker
spoke well and sensibly, but his words fell on dull
ears and cold hearts. The second speaker was a regular
son of thunder, and he did thunder, and storm,
and quake, and he made some of his hearers do the
same. When he got through with his “exhortation,”
he kneeled and said, “Let us pray.” He prayed,
and half of the assembly prayed with him. He
raised his voice, and they raised theirs; he screamed
like a maniac, and they did the same; he jumped up
and down, and they jumped up and down. I looked<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
on with utter amazement, having never witnessed
such a scene before. As soon as he had finished this
part of the performance, he told all to rise to their
feet, who wanted to go to heaven. I was the only
one who did not stand up. “Rise to your feet,” said
he, “or you will be damned.” I kept my seat, and
though strongly tempted to rebuke him, I said nothing.</p>

<p>Near Charleston, Va., I attended, for the first time,
a Methodist camp-meeting, and have not since been
anxious to renew my acquaintance with such gatherings.
It was held in a beautiful grove, and there
were present some two thousand people, black and
white. During the services, the whites were seated
in front of the speaker’s stand, and the negroes in its
rear. The speakers would talk awhile to their white
brethren, and then turn on their heels and give the
black brethren a broadside, and the latter always
responded to the condescension of the preachers with
a hearty shout. The night was the hour of promise;
then they were almost sure of being blessed with
copious showers of “grace.” Sunlight, it seems, is
not favorable to its descent; it comes more plentifully
with moonshine. The night I was on the ground,
there were all sorts of manifestations of the “spirit.”
Some laughed, others cried, groaned, and threw
themselves on the ground. I noticed one poor fellow
trying to climb a tree, and I asked him where he
was going. “To heaven,” said he, and he kept
scratching the tree with his finger and toe nails, for
he was bare-footed. The preachers and the hearers
generally, seemed to think all that hopping, jumping,
shouting and screaming, was the work of God in converting
the souls of the people. Every good thing
can be abused, and thus become an evil. Religious
excitement, when kept within due bounds, is productive
of much good, but when it overleaps all bounds,
and becomes temporary insanity, as it did on this<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
occasion, it is prostituted to a very bad purpose. I
spent a short time in the “preacher’s tent” where
the following conversation ensued:</p>

<p>“John Wesley was opposed to such excitement as
you have here.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied the Presiding Elder;
“that man of God was in favor of it, for he knew it
was the work of the spirit of God, and I warn you to
flee from the wrath to come, before it shall be eternally
too late.”</p>

<p>“Do not get excited, my friend. Let us see what
Wesley says about what you call the work of the
Holy Spirit. In one of his volumes he speaks of the
doings of Satan thus:—‘Satan strives to push many
of them to extravagance. This appears in several
instances:</p>

<p>“‘1. Frequently three or four, yea, ten or twelve,
pray aloud together.</p>

<p>“‘2. Some of them, perhaps, may scream altogether,
as loud as they can.</p>

<p>“‘3. Some of them use improper, yea, indecent expression
in prayer.</p>

<p>“‘Several drop down as dead, and are as stiff as a
corpse; but in a while they start up and cry, “glory,
glory!” perhaps twenty times together. Just so do
the French prophets, and very lately the Jumpers in
Wales, bringing the real work into contempt.</p>

<p>“‘Scream no more at the peril of your soul. God
now warns you by me. I never scream, I never
strain myself; I dare not, I know it would be a sin
against God and my own soul!</p>

<p>“‘Some very unstill sisters, who always took care to
stand near me, and tried who could cry loudest, since
I have had them removed out of my sight, they have
been as quiet as lambs. The first night I preached
here, one half of my words were lost through the
noise of their outcries; last night, before I began, I
gave public notice that whosoever cried as to drown<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
my voice, should, without man’s hurting or judging
them, be gently carried to the farthest corner of the
room, but my porters had no employment the whole
night.</p>

<p>“‘There is a fervor which has passed for devotion,
but it is not true, not scriptural devotion. It is loud
shouting, horrid, unnatural screaming, repeating the
same words twenty or thirty times, jumping two or
three feet high, throwing about the arms and legs,
both men and women, in a manner shocking not only
to religion, but to common decency.</p>

<p>“‘I dislike,</p>

<p>“‘1. Speaking or praying of several at once.</p>

<p>“‘2. Praying to the Son of God only, or more than
to the Father.</p>

<p>“‘3. The use of improper expressions in prayer.</p>

<p>“‘4. The using poor, flat, bald hymns.</p>

<p>“‘5. Those never kneeling in prayer. (They sat on
the floor.)</p>

<p>“‘6. Your using postures or gestures highly indecent.</p>

<p>“‘7. Your screaming, so as to make the words unintelligible.</p>

<p>“‘8. Your affirming people will be justified or sanctified
just now.</p>

<p>“‘9. The affirming they are where they are not.</p>

<p>“‘10. The bidding them, “I believe.”</p>

<p>“‘11. The bitterly condemning any that oppose,
calling them wolves, etc., and pronouncing them hypocrites,
or not justified!’</p>

<p>“These are Wesley’s words, and you have been
doing here nearly all he so severely rebukes. What
you call the work of God, he calls the work of
Satan.”</p>

<p>“Let us pray,” said the Elder, with an awful groan.
And such a prayer! It was not praying, but rather
the ravings of a mad man, and the crowd raved with
him. He called me the devil, and said I had slandered
the sainted Wesley, and had come there to stop<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
the work of God. He beseeched the Lord, either to
convert my soul or send me to hell. When he was
through, I told him that his performance was more
like the ravings of a maniac, than the simple prayer
of a Christian, and bid him good by.</p>

<p>After spending six months in this region, traveling
and preaching constantly, and seeing but slim prospect
for establishing our cause permanently there,
and receiving hardly any compensation for all my
hard labor, and many privations, I resolved to go to
Pittsburg, Pa. The truth is, I was much discouraged.
I had labored one year in Maryland, and
found but few sympathizers with me or my faith, and
had not received fifty dollars for all my toil. I was
tired of traveling, and longed for an abiding place
where I could preach without being constantly on the
wing, and where I could pursue my studies. I was
not avaricious, but thought, as I devoted all my time
to the ministry, I ought to be comfortably supported.
I regretted having come to the state, and certainly
should not have been there, had I known the religious
character of the people, and how few friends we
had in that region.</p>

<p>I went to Pittsburg by stage, stopped at several
places on the road, and delivered my message. Arriving
in that city, I became acquainted with S. A.
Davis, pastor of the church there, and publisher of
the <cite>Glad Tidings</cite>, a paper devoted to the good cause.
His church was numerically feeble, for liberal principles
had just begun to take root in that city as in the
West generally. Mr. Davis worked hard in the
double capacity of pastor and editor. He was a
pleasant speaker, fair writer, and a very excellent
man. His wife, who long since went to the better
world, possessed much talent, and wrote clever articles
for the <cite>Glad Tidings</cite>. He now resides in the
East, and is still in the Master’s service. His daughter,
Minnie Davis, is one of the best female writers in
the denomination. She has written several excellent
books, and contributes liberally to our periodical literature.</p>

<p>I had crossed the mountain barrier between the
East and the West, and was then in the Mississippi
Valley—merely though on its border. Its hills and
vales, its forests and prairies, its rivers and lakes,
were all before me towards the setting sun. Compare
the West <em>then</em> to the West <em>now</em>. Never since<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
earth’s foundation was laid, has any country exhibited
such rapid progress in so few years. The West has
made a thousand years growth in twenty-five years.
And is it destined to continue to grow at that rate?
The signs of the times indicate that it is even so.
The most vivid imagination can form but a faint conception
of the future greatness of the West. Columbus,
romantic and extravagant as were his visions,
could not have dreamed of half the glory of the
future West. Here fiction has already become fact,
and dreams realities.</p>

<p>I effected arrangements to travel and preach in
Pennsylvania and Ohio, for I soon learned that our
friends were few in the West, and that I should have
to travel extensively. I submitted to my fate and
went to work. Visited several places in Pennsylvania,
but meeting with little encouragement, I passed
into Ohio, where I found more friends. Preached in
many places in the Western Reserve, generally had
large congregations, and found many devoted believers
in the Great Salvation. A large portion of the
population of the Reserve were from the Eastern
states, and they brought industrious habits, correct
moral principles, and liberal religious sentiments with
them—the right kind of soil for Universalism to
grow in. But where wheat grows, there grows chaff,
and I encountered some intolerable bigotry in that
region. In Ashtabula a vinegar-faced gentleman accosted
me thus:</p>

<p>“I understand you are a Universalist preacher.”</p>

<p>“You have been correctly informed. Universalism
is only another name for the gospel. ‘A rose,’
you know, ‘by any other name would smell as
sweet.’”</p>

<p>“Sweet! Universalism the gospel! It is neither
sweet nor the gospel. It is a loathsome spawn from
hell, the meanest of all the devil’s mean works, and
you ought not to be allowed to teach it to immortal<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
souls. I would put a stop to such preaching had I
the power.”</p>

<p>“Very likely you would, for you look like a villain.
The mark of the beast is on you, and you would,
doubtless, like to be about your master’s business.
The world has been cursed a long time with the spirit
you possess, and with men of your character, and that
spirit, and that breed are not yet dead. Bigots and
hypocrites like you, nailed the Savior of man to the
cross, stoned Stephen, murdered the apostles, and
crucified, burnt, hung, beheaded, and quartered, the
saints of God in all ages.”</p>

<p>“If I believed as you do, I would take my fill of
sin.”</p>

<p>“You are full of sin <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>“What do you preach for?”</p>

<p>“To reform such men as <em>you</em>. You may think you
are a Christian of the first water, but you know nothing
about Christianity. The name of its Author is
Love, and Christianity corresponds, letter and spirit,
with that blessed word. But what do you know
about <em>love</em>? and what does your fiery creed know
about <em>love</em>? But you know what <em>hate</em> means, and
you would pursue all with fire and sword who do not
kneel at your shrine. I pray God that you may be
converted, that you may know the meaning of love,
mercy, goodness, justice, know that they do not signify
hatred, cruelty, vengeance, and that God is served
when we obey the law of love, not when we hate and
devour each other.”</p>

<p>On board of a steamboat, on the Ohio river, I participated
in the following conversation:</p>

<p>“I am free to acknowledge, that I cannot reconcile
endless misery with the goodness of God, and yet I
have to believe in that doctrine.”</p>

<p>“Others have admitted the same. The celebrated
Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great moralist of the last
century, admitted that God cannot be infinitely good<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
to the victims of ceaseless woe—so Boswell tells us.
We judge of a person’s character by his works. If
his works are evil, we infer his character is evil; if
his works are good, we infer that his character is
good. We are safe in judging of God’s character by
the same criterion. If he has built an everlasting
hell, and will consign his own offspring to its dismal
vaults, to be the victims of Almighty wrath, world
without end, and all for the errors of a day, it is
utterly impossible for Him to be <em>good</em>, much less,
<em>infinitely</em> good. Goodness seeks the <em>welfare</em>, not the
<em>ruin</em>, of the subjects of its power.”</p>

<p>“But your argument, if it is sound, proves, that
God is not infinitely good, for the world is full of
misery. All, the old and the young, the good and
the bad, suffer.”</p>

<p>“True, there is much suffering beneath the sun,
but I think it can be reconciled with the goodness of
the Creator. Consider, first, how short is our stay on
earth. Some are here a few hours, others a few days,
and none but a few years. Suppose there were nothing
in this world but suffering, but if an eternity of
bliss awaits us on the other side of the river, all the
sufferings of earth would afford no evidence that God
is not good. For every tear, every sigh, every woe,
we should have millions of ages of happiness. But
with very few exceptions, if there are any, all in this
world, enjoy far more than they suffer. There are
more muscles in the face for laughing than for weeping,
which proves that it is the will of our Creator
that there should be more happiness in our cup than
sorrow. As there is more sunshine than storm, so
more joy than grief falls to the lot of mortals. But
this should also be considered, most of the suffering
men endure, they bring on themselves by their ignorance
or willfulness. This is a beautiful world, a garden
of Eden, and if we observe the laws of the Creator,
taste not of the forbidden fruit, but partake only<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
of fruit from the tree of life, there would be but little
suffering in this world.”</p>

<p>“But we are informed, that man was forbidden to
partake of the tree of life.”</p>

<p>“Adam and Eve were forbidden while they were
unrepentant and sinful, and so are all while they possess
such a character. We cannot serve God and
Baal. If we serve the one we despise the other.
We cannot possess a sinful character, and a virtuous
character, cannot partake of the tree of evil and
of good at the same time. We are driven from the
one when we partake of the other. But if we flee
from the deadly shades of the upas, touch not, taste
not, handle not its poisonous fruit, the tree of life will
be accessible to us. We are told that the leaves of
the tree are for the healing of the nations, (Rev. xxii.
2,) showing, that it is now within our reach. Yes, if
we approach it with pure motives, clean hands, and
reverent steps, we can, even now, pluck its fruit and
live. But a flaming sword prevents access to it while
we are morally low, debased, groveling.”</p>

<p>“That is a new view of the subject; I will think
about it.”</p>

<p>“As all suffering in this world is of short duration,
and as we voluntary bring most we do suffer on ourselves,
and as we have reason to trust it will all, by
our Heavenly Father, be overruled for good, and be
succeeded by an eternity of blessedness, I cannot
see that the few tears, and aches of this brief life
militate against the goodness of the Creator. I am
sure, when we shall have passed through the strifes
and conflicts of this world, and can see the past in
the light of their results, in the light of eternity,
we will exclaim, ‘Love and mercy pursued us all the
days of our lives.’ But misery without mitigation or
end, without one ray of hope, nothing but an eternity
of gloom, and the most intense agony, can never be
reconciled with infinite goodness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>A few miles below Pittsburg, in Virginia—I now
forget the name of the place—I stopped one Saturday
evening, and told the people I would speak to
them the next day, if they would give me a hearing.
A citizen invited me to his house, and I delivered a
discourse on Sunday morning, to a large assembly.
In the middle of the afternoon, some ten or a dozen
persons entered the house where I was stopping, and
after being seated, the following ensued:</p>

<p>“Are you the man who preached in the school
house this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have called to let you know that you
must not hold another meeting in this town.”</p>

<p>“Why not? What is the matter, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Your doctrine is dangerous; it is infidelity, and
we want no more of it.”</p>

<p>“Did any of you hear my discourse to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, and we don’t want to hear such stuff.”</p>

<p>“How then do you know it is dangerous and infidel?”</p>

<p>“We are not here to have a controversy with you,
but to notify you that you cannot occupy the school
house this evening.”</p>

<p>My host here informed the gentlemen, that he had
an interest in that house, and that I <em>should</em> preach in
it if I desired to. “This gentleman,” said he, “is a
stranger in this place; I heard his sermon in the
morning, and although I know nothing about Universalism,
he uttered not a word I consider dangerous or
infidel.”</p>

<p>“When you reflect,” I remarked, “on the mean
business you are here on, you will be heartily ashamed
of yourselves, and your conduct. You admit you
did not hear me, and yet you are loud and angry in
your condemnation. I am a stranger in this place,
and to you; I have never harmed a hair of your
heads, and yet you treat me with savage rudeness.<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
Is this Virginia hospitality? What do you suppose
I teach?”</p>

<p>“We understand you teach, that there is no God,
no Savior, no hell, and that the good and the bad, go
to heaven together.”</p>

<p>“You have been misinformed. My advice to you
is, to acquaint yourselves with the principles you so
rudely condemn, for you are as ignorant of them as
the Hottentots are of English grammar.”</p>

<p>“We have no more to say to you, except to repeat,
that you must not again preach your abominations in
this town.”</p>

<p>“I expect to hold a meeting in town this evening,
and hope you will attend, and learn something of the
gospel of Jesus.”</p>

<p>Exit the inquisitors.</p>

<p>I held a meeting according to appointment, but
that company of bigots kept out of the way. They
found, however, they could neither rule me or the
town, for I had a much larger congregation after
their visit than before. Lectured in Wellsville, and
a Methodist minister replied in a good natured manner,
and we parted in friendship. Proceeded down
the Ohio river to Wheeling, where I lectured several
times, in a Baptist meeting-house, and then went to
Graves Creek, on the Virginia side of the river, and
there spent two weeks, speaking most every day in
town or country. C. G. Cox resided there, and
preached occasionally. My sojourn in this place is a
green spot in my memory, for I found some excellent
friends, which was really cheering after meeting with
so much opposition.</p>

<p>There is an artificial mound here, some eighty feet
high, of a conic shape, and very steep. When, or by
whom it was made, whether by the Indians, or a race
who preceded them, is unknown, and the mystery
will probably never be solved. A few years since a
shaft was extended through the base of the mound,<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
and a broken arch and some human bones were found
in the center, indicating that it was a monumental
structure.</p>

<p>A great portion of my traveling at this period was
on foot. I often walked twenty or twenty-five miles
in a day, and delivered a long discourse at night.
Traveling in this hard way, and preaching most every
day, I had but little time to read or write. When a
traveler asked Wordsworth’s servant, to show him his
master’s study, he answered, “Here is his library,
but his study is out of doors.” So, like him, my
study was out of doors. The Bible was my constant
companion, and the portions of it that most interested
me, were the New Testament, the Psalms, the book
of Job, the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. When weary,
I would sit by the wayside, and study the Book of
Life, and on resuming my march, would reflect on
what I had read, or arrange a sermon. My discourses
were seldom written, neither were they wholly
extemporaneous, for I often repeated portions of
them.</p>

<p>I journeyed to Steubenville, Ohio, where I spoke
twice; then to Marietta, and from thence to Chillicothe,
as I was then bound for Cincinnati. In Chillicothe,
I remained a week, and lectured four times.
While in this place, I had the following conversation
with a Presbyterian clergyman:</p>

<p>“What do you mean by salvation?”</p>

<p>“I mean, deliverance from evil tendencies, thoughts,
habits, purposes, and all of their long train of results.
This is a <em>perfect</em> salvation. It can be only partially
enjoyed in this world, at best; it will require the
grace, light and wisdom of eternity to perfect the
work. It may be commenced here, but cannot be
consummated in this lower world. And this is what
the New Testament means by salvation. ‘Thou
shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people
from their <em>sins</em>.’ Matt. i. 21. ‘Behold the Lamb of<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
God, who taketh away the <em>sin</em> of the world.’ John i.
28. ‘Unto you first, God having raised up his Son
Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning every one of
you from his <em>iniquities</em>.’ Acts iii. 25. ‘There shall
come out of Zion the deliverer, who shall turn away
<em>ungodliness</em> from Jacob; for this is the covenant unto
them, when I shall take away their <em>sins</em>.’ Rom. xi.
27. ‘There is no <em>condemnation</em> to them that are in
Christ Jesus.’ Rom. viii. 1. ‘Who gave himself for
us, that he might redeem us from all <em>iniquity</em>, and
purify unto himself a people zealous of good works.’
Titus ii. 14. ‘Because the creature [meaning mankind]
shall be delivered from the <em>bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty</em> of the children of God.’
Rom. viii. 21. These scriptures clearly teach what is
gospel salvation. The recipients of it are liberated
from the bondage of sin and error; the ‘chains of
darkness’ are broken, and they enjoy a glorious liberty,
a glorious deliveration, a glorious salvation.”</p>

<p>“True, that is salvation; but the Bible also speaks
of salvation from <em>hell</em>.”</p>

<p>“The only passage in the Bible where deliverance
from hell is spoken of reads thus:—‘For great is thy
mercy towards me; and thou hast <em>delivered my soul
from the lowest hell</em>.’ Psalms lxvi. 13. Here is hell,
the <em>lowest hell</em>, and the writer speaks of salvation
from it; but this hell is on earth, and the deliverance
is a <em>present</em> deliverance. David had sinned, and he
expressed his sins and their consequences by the
term, hell; but he repented, reformed, obtained forgiveness,
and was delivered from the lowest hell into
which he had been plunged. And it was the mission
of Jesus to save the world from just such a hell, and
from no other.”</p>

<p>“But the Bible speaks of salvation from hell in the
future world—an endless hell.”</p>

<p>“The Scriptures no where locate hell in the immortal
world. It is a condition of <em>moral corruption</em>,<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
and, the world knows by sad experience, that condition
is experienced in this life. The terms, ‘eternal hell,’
‘everlasting hell,’ ‘endless hell,’ do not once occur
in the good book. But if gospel salvation is deliverance
from such a wretched place, it is remarkable that
the sacred writers say nothing about it. The truth is,
God never made such a horrible place as theologians
denominate hell, and consequently nobody is exposed
to its fiery surges, and all this talk about salvation
from it, is simply idle talk. But men do cherish evil
thoughts, purposes, habits, and the salvation the Bible
contemplates is deliverance from those real evils.
Here is a trinity of evils, and to sever them from our
souls and from our life; to purify our thoughts, correct
our habits, and rightly direct our purposes,
should be the end and aim of life. But to spend
life’s golden moments, trying to dodge imaginary
evils, evils which exist only in our creeds, and thereby
make ourselves miserable, is foolish, is suicidal.
The only hell we need fear is <em>within</em> our own souls,
not without, and away in yonder world; and if half
the effort was made to save the world from that hell,
that is made to save it from imaginary torments beyond
the grave, much more would be accomplished
for humanity.”</p>

<p>Proceeded to Bainbridge, where I spent several
days, and delivered four sermons to an excited people.
The doctrine of the Restitution was hardly
known there, even by name, but all classes attended
my meetings to hear the youthful speaker, and to
learn something of his strange doctrine. Some were
mad and some were glad. One minister treated me
very kindly, and assisted several times in the services,
but another was boiling over with rage, but he heard
me through. At the close of the second discourse, he
jumped to his feet, and told the people that the speaker
believed in no hell or devil, and for my part, he
added, I would as soon deny that there is a God or a<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
heaven. I kindly informed him that he was mistaken,
that he had not understood me; that I believed
in all the hells and devils the Bible speaks of, and no
more; that possibly we might differ relative to the
Bible meaning of those subjects, and that it was very
uncharitable to assert that I denied the Bible because
I differed from him in understanding it. Doing that
is not denying the Bible, but simply differing from
the gentleman. He then dashed into Revelation to
prove that the devil was a huge monster, almost
equal to the Almighty, had his throne in the infernal
regions, where he reigned, “monarch of all he surveyed,”
and that his eagle eye, from the center of
hell, beheld this earth and all therein, and he not only
attended to his infernal duties at home, but was constantly
besieging every man, woman and child of
earth, and never forsook a soul till it was fairly within
the gates of the New Jerusalem. I replied, that there
was this difference between the speaker and myself—he
was a <em>Pagan</em> and I was a <em>Christian</em>; I believed
in <em>one</em> God, and he, at least, in <em>two</em>—the God of
heaven, and the god of hell. And I exhorted him to
abandon his Paganism and embrace Christianity.
He cooled down some, and at the close of the meeting
gave me his hand. I entered Bainbridge a total
stranger, and departed from it with the blessings of
many.</p>

<p>I went to Cincinnati by stage, and oh, what roads!
There were no railroads then, not even turnpikes. It
was mud, mud, mud, nothing but mud; stiff, black,
deep mud. I forget how many times the stage broke
down, how many horses were killed, or how many
times all hands had to get out into the ocean of mud,
and pry the stage out of the mud. But I do remember,
that when we reached Cincinnati, the horses,
driver, stage and passengers, were covered with rich
Buckeye mud. Mr. West was then preaching in the
Queen city, in a small house, on Walnut street, and<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
Mr. Tizard and George Rogers were publishing the
<cite>Star in the West</cite>. Cincinnati then contained only
twenty-five thousand inhabitants, but now its population
is fully two hundred thousand. Still, it was then
<em>the</em> city of the West. St. Louis and Chicago were
then mere villages, now each of them is equal to
Cincinnati in population. Surely, western cities are
great <em>growers</em>. Preached several times in C., and
made many pleasant acquaintances. I was urged to
remain and labor in the vicinity, but I had resolved
to go South, and no persuasion could change my purpose.
I had to learn my mistake by experience.</p>

<p>I went on foot, down the Ohio river. Stopped at
North Bend, saw General Harrison, who then resided
there, and spent several hours in his company. He
was very kind and social. He told me he had
thought much about religion, believed in its reality
and usefulness, that he could not subscribe to the
eternity of punishment, but did not know about the
salvation of all; but added the General, “I believe
God is just, wise, good and merciful, and that all will
end well, but what that end is to be I know not. I
must wait for the developments of the great teacher—death.”
Soon after, he was elected President of
the United States. I saw him several times during
the presidential campaign; heard him make his Dayton
speech to congregated thousands, and read with
tearful eyes, the announcement of his death, one
short month after his inauguration, and have since
lingered around his grave, on the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p>I next went to Rising Sun, Ind., where I preached
every day for a week. This was my first advent into
Indiana. Since then, I have traveled through its
length and its breadth, and preached in nearly every
town within its borders. Much interest was manifested
in the meetings at Rising Sun, and large congregations
attended. One man, I was informed, a
member of some orthodox church, who attended one<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
of the meetings, became so excited, during the service,
that he ate all the tobacco he could find in his pockets—three
large plugs. Since then, a society has
been organized there, and a church built. Perhaps
the good seed sown then, in after years yielded some
fruit. Seven miles down the river is Patriot, where
I stopped ten days, and delivered five discourses.
The principal families of the place were of the liberal
faith, excellent people, and practical Christians.
They loved the truth, loved to talk about it, and
loved to attend the services of the sanctuary. That
place was an oasis in the desert—no controversy, no
denunciation, but peace, love and harmony reigned.
A fine meeting-house was built soon after I was
there, and the society prospered for several years.
But pecuniary misfortunes overtaking some of the
leading members, and the business of the town diminishing,
nearly broke up the society. After a pleasant
sojourn with the Patriot friends, I went to Louisville,
Ky., where I preached several times in a large hall.
I had not been in Kentucky before, but since then
have traveled extensively in that state. In this city,
E. M. Pingree lived, studied, labored and died. He
died young, in the midst of usefulness, loved and
honored by all who knew him. He was a strong
man, gathered many friends around him, and built
up what seemed to be a permanent society, but it did
not prosper long after his death, and is now extinct.
Gad Chapin was in L. on my first visit, and is there
still—a patriarch in our Israel.</p>

<p>At Louisville I took passage on the steamer “Commercial”
for New Orleans, fifteen hundred miles
down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Nothing of
much interest occurred on the voyage. I delivered
three discourses, at the request of the captain and
passengers, on three subjects—Judgment, Punishment,
Salvation—and theological points were the
principal subjects of discussion the ten days occupied<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
in going to New Orleans. The merits and demerits
of Universalism were pretty freely canvassed by all,
from the captain to the barber. Captain Rudd, the
commander, was of the liberal faith. I met him in
after years in St. Louis, where he died of yellow
fever. He was a good officer, and a generous friend.</p>

<p>I arrived at New Orleans in January. Ten days
had transported me from winter to summer weather;
from where the earth was bound in chains of ice, and
covered with snow, to where mother earth was teeming
with vegetable life, and covered with a carpet, in
which were blended the tints of the rainbow. Jack
Frost was busy, biting ears and fingers, in Louisville,
but in New Orleans gnats and musquitoes were
fully as eager to bite at every exposed point. I
heard Dr. Clapp, but he had not then embraced the
better faith, and I formed no acquaintance with him.
I traveled all over the city, and visited the battle
ground where General Jackson gave the English
such a drubbing. I wanted to preach on the spot,
but could not find a door of entrance. No one
seemed to care for any thing but money, and dissipation.
Mammon and Bacchus were the gods mostly
worshiped. The churches on Sunday were nearly
empty, but the theaters, museums, gambling dens,
and grog-shops, were crowded. There were doubtless
some righteous men there, but to a stranger, they
seemed to be as scarce as they were in Sodom of old.</p>

<p>Desiring to see more of the world, I embarked for
Matagorda, Texas, on board of a brig, bound for that
place. A steam tug towed us to the Balize, and we
were soon winding our way towards the destined
port. There were many emigrants on board, going
to Texas, to make themselves homes. As soon as it
became known that I was a clergyman, I was invited
to hold services. I stood on the quarter-deck, my
hearers, numbering about one hundred, gathered
around me—some on deck and some in the rigging.
My text was, “And he arose, and rebuked the winds,
and the sea, and there was a great calm.” I commenced
by speaking of the storms to which the sea is
subject, and then spoke of that <span class="smcap">One</span>, who has perfect
control of its mountain waves, and of the hurricane
that lashes the mighty deep into such fury. One word
from Him turned the headlong tornado into a calm,
and the angry surges into repose. Life is a sea, and
we are all voyagers, sailing from port to port. Sometimes
we have fair weather, and sometimes foul
weather. To-day the sun may shine bright, and the
air be as gentle as an infant’s breath, and our bark<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
may glide smoothly along, like a vessel on the mirrored
deep; to-morrow, clouds and darkness may
gather around, the storms of human passion, or of
adversity may threaten the destruction of us and ours,
and in despair we may give up all as lost. But let us
remember, through the whole journey of life, that
there is One who controls the storms of life as well as
the storms of the ocean, and to every troubled heart
he does or will say, “Peace—be still.” A hymn
was sung, in which nearly all, sailors and passengers,
participated.</p>

<p>In an hour after services, a small cloud was observed
in the west. The captain, knowing what it betokened,
ordered the vessel put in trim for a gale. In a
few minutes, the wind was howling through the rigging,
and the vessel plunging from wave to wave, as
if eager to flee from the wrath of the storm-king.
The gale continued above an hour, when the wind
abated, the clouds dispersed, the sun shone bright,
and the sea soon became as smooth as a mirror.
That latitude, at that season of the year, is subject to
such gusts of passion. A few nights after, when I
was sound asleep on the quarter-deck, for it was too
hot to rest below, one of these gales crossed our
track, and a huge wave breaking over the vessel,
dashed me across the deck, when I scrambled up, and
ran into the cabin, not fancying so unceremonious a
sea-bath. One night, a man jumped overboard, and
was lost—he must have been insane. Friends at
home probably waited with alternate hope and fear
for his return, and, perhaps, never knew of his sad
fate. At that time, Mexico and Texas were at war,
and armed vessels were in the gulf looking after
prizes. One day, a large ship was observed in the
distance, bearing down upon us, without showing colors.
Our captain was alarmed. With a pale face,
he eyed the stranger through his telescope. We
were all fearful it was a Mexican armed vessel, and<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
that we should be taken into Matamoras; but we
were finally relieved by the ship showing English
colors, tacking eastward and leaving us.</p>

<p>We sailed up the Matagorda bay a few miles, but
the water being shallow, I got on board a lighter, and
went to a village, the name of which I do not now
remember. When I landed in Texas, I supposed I
had delivered my last sermon. I had become tired
of wandering about the world, and had had no opportunity
to settle before I had concluded to quit the
ministry. But going to Texas at that early day to
find a home, was certainly a wild and foolish project;
and I had been there but a short time, when I repented
in sackcloth and ashes, for having taken the step I
had, and resolved to return to the United States, and
continue in the ministry. I immediately commenced
making preparation to go to Houston by the land
route, and thence to New Orleans by water. The
distance to Houston was one hundred and sixty miles,
and I resolved to go there on foot. Being informed
that there were but few inhabitants on the road, and
most of them in a starving condition, as the Mexican
army had the season previous passed through that
region, I carried food to last me to the end of my
land journey. No tea, coffee, sugar, salt or flour
could be obtained for love or money. Every body
lived on fresh beef, without salt, pepper or butter,
save here and there an aristocrat who had a little
corn meal in his larder. I bought some beef, cut it
in slices, and dried it in the sun.</p>

<p>With a good supply of dried beef, and nothing else,
a tin canteen, a blanket and a staff, I commenced
my journey, on foot and alone, through the wild prairies
of Texas. I found the country to be nearly all
prairie, the surface quite level, and the soil rich and
deep. The forest trees were generally covered with
ivy, which gave them a melancholy appearance.
Live oaks abounded in some localities. Alligators<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
flourished in the streams, and Indians, snakes, tarantulas
and horned toads on the land. I often traveled
a day without seeing a human being or his habitation.
When night came on, I would stop, eat my dried
beef, drink some water, which I had carried, perhaps,
all day, and then roll myself in my blanket, lay on
the ground, and go to sleep, not knowing that there
was a human being within miles of me. I was four
weeks in going to Houston, and did not sleep in a
house one night during that time.</p>

<p>I well remember how I suffered one day from
thirst. It was a very warm day, and my little stock
of water was exhausted at my morning repast. I
expected to find more of the blessed beverage about
noon in a small grove. I reached the spot, but no
water was there; the bed where there had been a
stream was dry and hard. It was a sore disappointment,
for I was very thirsty. As I could not eat my
dry beef without water, I pressed towards the Colorado
river, which seemed to be about fifteen miles distant,
for I could see the timber bordering on the
stream. I reached the timber a little after dark, but
how far it was to the river, I knew not. I plunged
into the forest in the direction I knew the stream
must lay, as it ran southward. The moon, which had
just risen, was my only guide, for be it known, I was
on no road. It proved to be about four miles to the
river, and how I got through, I know not. There
was no path, the thick foliage of the forest admitted
but little moonlight, and the underbrush, vines and
branches of trees, made the whole distance a perfect
thicket. But I went through with a rush, regardless
of scratches, snakes, or anything else, for water I
must have. About ten o’clock, I reached the bank
of the river, reflecting the full moon, which had been
my guide through the dense forest; and never did a
traveler on the Arabian desert behold the long sought
pool with more delight. It seemed to be my friend,<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
my savior; and if I had been an idolator, I should
have fallen down and worshiped it. I filled my canteen,
and drank till I was satisfied. I then bathed
my head, face, hands and feet in the glorious river.
On the bank I partook of my humble repast—dried
beef and water—with a thankful heart. With my
blanket around me, I laid down on the ground and
slept, never better, till the hot morning sun, shining
in my face, awaked me, when it was about two hours’
high. I have often wondered how I dared to sleep
that night, knowing as I did, that there were alligators
in the river, and bears, wolves, and poisonous
reptiles in the woods. In the morning, I again partook
of beef and water, with an excellent relish.</p>

<p>But a new difficulty now presented itself. A deep
river was before me, without a bridge or a boat, and
I could not swim. But cross the stream I must by
some means. In the first place, I explored the river,
up and down, several miles, hoping to find some one
to aid me, but not a sign of a human being, or human
habitation could I discover. I resolved to attempt to
cross the river on a log, and after much hard work
succeeded in getting two logs of sufficient size, into
the water, fastened them together with strips of my
blanket, and with pole in hand, launched into the
river. The stream being quite rapid, my frail craft
floated down about one mile, but I safely landed on
the opposite shore without much trouble. After wandering
in the canebrakes two hours, I struck a road,
and thanked God and took courage.</p>

<p>I soon came to a house, and had the good fortune
to obtain a quart of corn, which I ground in an old
coffee mill, and made some excellent corn bread of
meal and water. I passed through San Felipe,
where was once a village, but only its ruins then
remained, for the Mexicans had destroyed it. Waking
one morning about sunrise, I was amazed by the
presence of six naked Indians, squatted in the grass<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
around me. I jumped to my feet; they saw that I
was astonished, but I noticed they smiled. Taking
courage by that friendly token, I walked up to them,
and extended my right hand. They offered me the
pipe of peace, which was gladly accepted. They did
not understand a word of English, nor I a word of
Indian. We talked, however, in gestures. They
remained an hour, when we separated in friendship.</p>

<p>When within thirty miles of Houston, I sold my
watch for fifteen dollars, expecting that I should need
the money to help pay expenses to the States. After
receiving the money, I heard a woman remark, “It
will do him no good, for he will spend it all for liquor
in Houston.” I suppose she would have thought I
lied, if I had told her that I had never drank a glass
of liquor. Arriving at Houston, I renovated self and
clothing, for both were rather dilapidated. Samuel
Houston was then president of Texas. I was in company
with him several times, and dined once in the
log-cabin, where he boarded. He was a good talker,
but an awful swearer. Oath after oath rolled from
his tongue without an effort. It is said that General
Jackson was an <em>eloquent</em> swearer, but I have doubts
of his beating General Houston in that department of
eloquence. I witnessed his departure for the interior
of Texas, to treat with some Indian tribes. The ferryman
did not handle the boat to suit the president,
and he poured battery after battery of oaths on the
poor fellow’s head. On leaving, he embraced, after
the French fashion, his friends, who had followed him
to the boat. I was on the San Jacinto battle ground,
a few miles from the city. It was a short but decided
contest. The Mexican forces were totally routed, and
Santa Anna taken prisoner. That battle crowned
Houston with glory and honor in Texas. The town
of Houston, when I was there, was a moral desert.
Vice of most every name and grade reigned triumphant—it
was a hell on earth. The Attorney-General<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
of Texas, while I was there, roamed the streets
half of one night, drunk, and hatless, coatless, bootless,
daring any one to fight with him. The people
laughed about it as if it was a trifling matter, and of
common occurrence. It is to be hoped that the morals
of that place have improved.</p>

<p>Wishing to go to New Orleans by water, I went in
a lighter down Buffalo bayou to Galveston bar, where
the steamer was anchored. The passage down occupied
three days, and that vessel was a perfect pandemonium—the
officers and hands were quarreling or
fighting most of the time. Dirks and pistols were
freely used. Buckwheat cakes and fat hog-sides
were served to us three times a day. And oh, what
cakes! The cook baked them about an inch thick,
without any rising properties, and put them on the
table stone cold. Fine cakes—thick, cold and solid.
I finally reached the steamer, and the captain promised
us a quick passage and good fare. But I soon
learned, when it was too late, that the boat was an
old, rotten, condemned hulk; that provisions were
scarce, and that the captain was a scamp. Time and
again the engine broke, or some of the running gear.
Water and food soon being exhausted, we were
allowed one pint of water and one Boston cracker
per day. The fuel being all consumed, we had to
burn part of the boat to get into port. We were a
week in going from Galveston bar to the mouth of
the Mississippi river, when the trip should have been
made in thirty-six hours. Fortunately we had pleasant
weather, for one such squall as we had going out,
would have sent the whole concern to the bottom of
the gulf.</p>

<p>When I returned to New Orleans it was mid-summer,
and the city presented a very different appearance
from what it did when I was there the previous
winter. Then business was at its zenith, now at its
nadir; then the hotels, streets and marts of trade<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
were crowded, now there was plenty of room; then
steamboats and vessels were receiving and discharging
freight for and from every clime, now the shipping
was very meager; then the weather was pleasant,
now the heat was scorching, burning, melting;
then it was healthy, now the yellow fever and almost
every other fever, was raging. Exposure and hard
fare in Texas, ultimated in ague and fever. I had
several chills while in Houston; when at sea beyond
the land breeze, I was free from them; but as soon as
I inhaled the air from shore, they returned with
increased violence, and it was two years before I
entirely regained my former good health.</p>

<p>I was soon on board of a steamer bound for Cincinnati,
and after a voyage of two weeks, landed at
Leavenworth, Ind., where I remained three months
doctoring for the ague.</p>

<p>Partially recovering, I resumed my former work of
traveling and preaching. E. B. Mann resided near
Leavenworth, and labored in the counties in Indiana
and Kentucky, bordering on the Ohio river. He also
distributed a large number of denominational books.
His circuit, which was about two hundred miles round,
he traveled on horseback, once a month. He was not
graced by education or refinement, yet his labors were
blessed with a good degree of success. He is now
dead, and his mortal remains repose near Leavenworth,
the center of his labors for many years.</p>

<p>I lectured in L. and vicinity three weeks, and then
proceeded to Louisville, Ky. N. Wadsworth was
then residing there, and publishing a paper called
<cite>The Berean</cite>; and at his earnest solicitation, I spent
three months in obtaining subscribers for it. Mr. W.
was formerly a Methodist minister, but then cherished
a more liberal faith. His talent was above mediocrity,
his acquirements fair, was a good man, and devoted
to the cause he espoused, and the profession of his
choice. He was small in stature, and feeble in health—too<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
small and feeble for his large and active mind.
A year after, he moved to Troy, Mo., his periodical
was discontinued, and he died of consumption, after
laboring there with excellent success, about one year.
His widow resides there still, and although she has
changed her name, the home of brother and sister
Sydnor is ever a welcome retreat for our ministers.
It has been my privilege to spend many pleasant
hours in their company. The humble grave of my
early friend is in the Troy cemetery; and I have read
the brief monumental inscription on the cold marble
at its head, through tearful eyes.</p>

<p>I bought a horse of Mr. Wadsworth, and agreed to
pay him in obtaining subscribers for his paper. It
was the first horse I ever owned, and I felt quite rich,
and very independent. I preached in most of the
towns within fifty miles of Louisville, in Kentucky
and Indiana. In Salem, Ind., I delivered a series of
sermons. A merchant there told me that his counting-room
was his chapel, his ledger his Bible, and
money his religion. He was then doing a large and
lucrative business. A few years after, he had no
counting-room, no ledger, no money, and died a miserable
death—the natural result of so profane a life.
General Clarke, an old Indian warrior, resided near
Salem. He attended my meetings, and I was often
at his house. He said he had helped steal Kentucky
and Indiana from the Indians. He was an intelligent
man, but a zealous Atheist. He admitted that
faith in a God of goodness, wisdom and justice, and
in the immortal blessedness of mankind, was more
satisfactory, and yielded more happiness than Atheism;
and if such exalted and benevolent sentiments
had received his attention ere his present views had
become permanently established, he might have embraced
them, but now he was too old to learn. I used
to rejoin, that his admission was fatal to his creed.
If a belief in God and immortality confers more happiness<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
than the denial of a God, and a hereafter, that
was the best evidence that Atheism was false, and
religion truth, for truth always confers more happiness
than error. Virtue is truth and vice is falsehood,
because the former is adapted to our nature,
and makes us happy, while the latter is a violation of
our nature, and darkens and deforms the mind. For
the same reason your theory, I would add, must be
false, and mine correct. Not “too old to learn,”
General. Your body is frail—it has been dying
these many years, but your mind is vigorous. Why
stop learning? If religion is true, death, that is fast
destroying your body, will not invade your mind—that
will live to learn forever.</p>

<p>Near Salem was a cave, containing water, in which
were fish without eyes. God creates no superfluities.
The fish of every sea, lake, river, have eyes, because
there is light in those waters, but the beams of the
sun had never penetrated that cavern, therefore eyes
were useless, and hence the denizens of that eternal
dungeon, have no visional organ. Nothing is created
in vain; every thing answers some useful purpose in
the economy of the Creator. Here is a solid foundation
on which to rest.</p>

<p>In Bedford, Ind., a Presbyterian minister abruptly
attacked me at the close of a discourse. “If the
pains of the damned will cease,” said he, “so will
the joys of the saved; for the words that express
the misery of the one, express the happiness of the
other.” Never, I replied, was a man more mistaken.
The Bible speaks of endless life, but not a word about
endless death. The terms, “endless death,” “endless
misery,” “endless woe,” “endless damnation,” “endless
hell,” found in the creeds of men, do not once
occur in the Bible. Read all that Moses and the
prophets, Jesus and the apostles, said or wrote, and
you will not find those terms once, not even once, in
the Old or New Testaments. “Endless” life is a<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
Bible term, but those other <em>endlesses</em> are wretched
fictions. The Bible says, “O <em>hell</em>, I will be thy
<em>destruction</em>;” but where does it say, “O <em>heaven</em>, I will
be thy destruction?!”</p>

<p>Finding but few persons of the liberal faith in the
vicinity of Louisville, I concluded to go to Ohio.
Preached in Cincinnati, Mount Healthy, Hamilton,
Oxford and Middletown. In the latter place a clergyman
attended my meetings, and at the close of
every sermon entered his solemn protest against what
had been said. He was a German, and in one of his
harangues said, “This fellow believes the fire will be
<em>squenched</em>, and I believe the fire will not be <em>squenched</em>.”
But he became so interested, that he proposed traveling
with me a few weeks, but not caring about his
company, I did not accept of his proposition.</p>

<p>Proceeded to Dayton; and having reference to no
one, I called on the sheriff, and engaged the Court-house
for the next day—Sunday. Wrote some
notices of the proposed meeting, and while putting
them up in different parts of the town, a gentleman
introduced himself, who proved to be the mayor of
the city. He kindly informed me of a man of my
faith, on whom I called, and was received with a
hearty welcome. I delivered two discourses on Sunday,
and on Monday morning was preparing to leave
town, when several friends called on me, and urged
me to remain, at least, a few months. The town,
they said, had just been scourged by a crazy revival,
and if I should tarry there awhile, they were sure a
good society would be established. I told them I
could not remain, as I was under obligation to travel
to extend the circulation of <cite>The Berean</cite>, and must
soon have, at least, seventy subscribers, to discharge
my obligation to its publisher. “If that number
should be obtained in this town, will you tarry with
us?” queried the gentlemen. I replied, that I would.
Notice was given that there would be a meeting that<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
evening. I delivered a discourse, and at the close of
it, a friend informed the congregation, that I had consented
to remain three months, if seventy subscribers
should be obtained in town for <cite>The Berean</cite>; and in a
few minutes the required number were secured. We
soon organized a society, a choir, and our meetings
were well attended during my sojourn in that pleasant
town. I wrote two sermons every week, and
committed them to memory—did not take the manuscript
into the desk with me. The society paid me
one hundred dollars for my services. My health not
being good, I declined remaining after the three
months had expired I stipulated to remain. The
society, after I left, built a meeting-house, and prospered
for several years. I am not informed of its
present condition.</p>

<p>While residing in Dayton, I visited Springfield,
Centerville, and many other places within twenty or
thirty miles of the city, in all of which I delivered
my message. In the former place, George Messenger,
a minister of the Common Salvation, was residing,
and the society was building a meeting-house. D. R.
Biddlecom, well known in the West as a minister of
the Restitution, visited me while I resided in Dayton.
He was then traveling and scattering the good seed
broadcast over the land. He now lives in Dayton,
and is still engaged in the good work.</p>

<p>Taking leave of my dear friends in Dayton, I proceeded
to Cincinnati. Stopped in Mason, and delivered
four sermons. Here I met Robert Smith, a singular
kind of a man, but of considerable ability. He
deemed it wrong to pray in public, baptize, or partake
of the eucharist. Some of his views being offensive
to our people, he was often coldly treated. This
offended him, and he subsequently joined the Reformers,
prayed in public, eat bread and drank wine every
Sabbath, and taught that immersion in water is a condition
of salvation. When I returned to Cincinnati,<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
J. A. Gurley was publishing the <cite>Star in the West</cite> in
that city. He was an active and enterprising man,
possessed respectable talent, and was a forcible speaker.
He was a popular preacher in the West, as long
as he continued in the ministry. He made himself a
beautiful home near Cincinnati, and lived under his
own vine and fig-tree. Having made two or three
hundred thousand dollars—on paper—by Chicago
town-lots, he abandoned the <cite>Star</cite> and the ministry,
and jumped into the muddy pool of politics. He
was a member of Congress two terms, and when he
died, was governor of Arizona. Here I met for the
first time, George Rogers, a well known minister of
our faith, and the author of several acceptable books.
During his brief ministry, he traveled extensively in
the South and West, publishing the glad tidings of
life and immortality. He was a little man physically,
but a great man intellectually and morally; his voice
was feeble, but his words were weighty. He broke
down a good constitution by hard labor, and died in
the prime of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers had recently traveled in the interior
and western portions of Indiana, and advised me to
spend a few months in those sections of that state.
In a few days I was on the road, bound for Indiana.
It was then the middle of May, 1838, and I did not
expect to return till the latter part of autumn.
Mounting my faithful horse, I rode to Harrison,
where I preached in the evening. As soon as I had
said amen, George Campbell, a Reformer, expressed
a desire to reply. He was told he would be heard
with attention. Among other things he remarked,
“That Universalism is a <em>new doctrine</em>, and therefore
cannot be the gospel, for that is <em>old</em>—most eighteen
hundred years old.” I replied, that it was as old
as revelation; and that several of its distinguishing
features were revealed to our first parents by the Creator.
To them he said, “In the day you sin you<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
shall surely die.” They did sin, and they died the
death threatened. St. Paul calls it a “death in trespasses
and in sins;” “to be carnally minded,” he says,
“is death,” and he terms this death the wages of sin.
This is the death—a moral death—that God threatened
the primitive pair; and if we sin we die the same
death—no mistake about that. Mark also the important
fact, that they were to suffer this punishment in
<span class="allsmcap">THE DAY</span> they sinned. It was not to be deferred till
the next day, next year, or next world, but in the
day, when and where they sinned, they were to begin
to suffer the penalty of transgression. It is as true
now as it was six thousand years ago, that in <em>the day</em>
we sin we are punished; it is as true in this town as
it was in the Garden of Eden, that in <em>the day</em> we sin
we are punished; it is as true of us as it was of Adam
and Eve, that in <em>the day</em> we sin we are punished.
Truth is eternal; the laws of God are unchangable,
the same yesterday, to-day and forever. As sin and
its penalty were chained together in the beginning,
it is thus now, and ever will be thus. Here then, in
the beginning, we are taught the <em>certainty</em> of punishment—“in
the day you sin you <em>shall</em> be punished;”
and here also we are taught, that punishment is <em>immediate</em>—in
the day they sinned the penalty was to
overtake them. These ancient truths we believe and
preach—they are portions of the gospel. But my
friend, Mr. Campbell, denies all this. He contends
that punishment is <em>not certain</em>, is <em>not immediate</em>; that
a person may sin three-score years and ten, without
being punished, for remember, he denied that God
judges in the earth; he said, that was a new doctrine,
one of our heresies, it was not taught in the Bible.
He also teaches, that a man, after spending seventy
years in crime of the blackest dye, can, by complying
with certain conditions, escape all punishment in eternity,
and occupy as high a seat in heaven as St. Paul
or St. John. In a word, Mr. C. denies squarely and<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
fully the everlasting truth of the ancient record, that
“in <em>the day</em> you sin you <em>shall</em> be punished.”</p>

<p>But the gentleman is not the <em>first</em> to make that
denial, and this is not the first <em>place</em> where this <em>truth</em>
has been called a <em>lie</em>. He has an ancient precedent,
he is following an old leader, has taken lessons from
an old master. The serpent preached in Eden’s garden
just what the gentleman has been preaching here
to-night, with so much zeal. “<em>Ye shall not surely
die</em>,” said his snakeship; God will not <em>surely</em> punish
you; there is a way to escape. Besides, don’t believe
a word of it, that you will be punished in <em>the day</em> you
sin. Mr. C. has taken the serpent’s text this evening,
and I give him credit for sticking to the text of
the father of lies. Our doctrine, then, relative to
punishment, is not <em>new</em>, neither is Mr. Campbell’s
doctrine, concerning punishment, <em>new</em>. But ours and
his came from different sources; one is of God, who is
the author of truth, the other is of the serpent, the
father of lies. They are both ancient doctrines, but
judge ye which is true.</p>

<p>The doctrine of salvation—universal salvation—is
not a new thing, either, under the sun, as Mr. C.
affirmed. Immediately after sin, and its dire results,
entered into the world, and while the first sinners
were yet trembling with guilt in the blissful garden,
it was revealed to them that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent’s head. It is generally considered
that “the seed of the woman” was the future
Christ, whose advent occurred four thousand years
afterwards. This <em>seed</em> was promised through the
Jewish patriarchs—“In thee and in thy <em>seed</em> shall all
nations of the earth be blessed.” And St. Paul distinctly
asserts, that Jesus is here intended. “Now to
Abraham and his <em>seed</em> were the promises made. He
saith not, And to <em>seeds</em>, as of many; but as of one,
And to thy <em>seed</em>, which <span class="smcap">is Christ</span>.” Gal. iii. 16. The
<em>seed</em>, then, promised to our first parents, and to the<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
patriarchs, was Jesus Christ. He was to bruise the
serpent’s head. Serpent, in the Bible, is a symbol of
sin. As a serpent is a low, vile and cruel reptile, so
vice is low, vile and cruel. It worms its slimy folds
into our thoughts, purposes, character, and life, and
is sure to poison every thing it touches. But Jesus
Christ is to bless all nations, by bruising the serpent’s
<em>head</em>. When we wish to kill a snake, our blows are
aimed at his <em>head</em>; so Jesus is to crush the head of
the serpent, that is, destroy sin, and thus <em>bless all nations</em>,
as the patriarchs were promised.</p>

<p>Three vitally important truths, then, were revealed
to mankind in the morning of creation. 1st. Punishment
for transgressing is <em>certain</em>. 2d. It is <em>immediate</em>.
3d. Sin and its results are temporary, for it is
the purpose and promise of God that the seed of the
woman shall make an end of sin, and thus bless all
the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Campbell’s discourse was disposed
of, a Presbyterian minister, by the name of Thomas,
spent half an hour in trying to prove that countless
millions of Adam’s race would be the victims of Almighty
wrath, world without end. I replied to him,
and when we got through it was midnight. The congregation
was large, and was so deeply interested that
nearly all remained till that late hour. The next
Sunday, I delivered two discourses in the Snow Settlement,
to immense assemblies. The meetings were
held in a grove, and a wagon was my pulpit. In
Brookville, I also spoke to the people. Father St.
John, a venerable man, resided there, and for many
years occasionally dispensed the word of life. His
silvery locks are now in the grave, but his soul, I trust,
is with God. Spent several days in West Union, and
although I told the people that God was their Father,
Friend and Benefactor, some treated me with bitter
malignity—threatened to drive me out of town, and
even to horse-whip me. Since then, a better spirit<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
has prevailed. There is now a society and meeting
in that place. Let not the reformer despair if his
mission is rejected; every crucified truth will rise
again, and go on conquering and to conquer.</p>

<p>Spent a Sunday in Connersville, preached twice,
and heard John O’Kane, a noted minister among the
Reformers, once. He has, since then, held several
oral debates with our ministers. Not knowing much
about the faith of his sect, I asked him the following
questions, and received the subjoined answers:</p>

<p>“What must we do to be saved?”</p>

<p>“Believe in Christ, repent of our sins, and be baptized.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by baptism?”</p>

<p>“Immersion in water.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, that no one can be saved
without immersion?”</p>

<p>“There is no promise that any one can.”</p>

<p>“That is not answering my question. Do <em>you</em> contend
that there is no salvation without water baptism?”</p>

<p>“The New Testament gives us no assurance, that a
soul can be redeemed without baptism.”</p>

<p>“But what is <span class="allsmcap">YOUR</span> opinion?”</p>

<p>“No matter what my opinion may be.”</p>

<p>“Cannot the heathen be saved without being baptized?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with the heathen.”</p>

<p>“Cannot children, dying in childhood, be saved
without being baptized?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit that <em>one third</em> of mankind are
saved without baptism. But you just said, that baptism
was a <em>condition</em> of salvation, and that you had no
evidence a soul could be saved without complying
with that condition. Your system contradicts itself.
If God can save one third of mankind without baptism,
can he not save the remaining two thirds without
baptism?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“I have no evidence that he will.”</p>

<p>Since I had this conversation with Mr. O’Kane, I
have often come in contact with persons of his denomination,
and they all contradict themselves as he did.
They all assert, that water baptism is a condition of
salvation, without any qualification or exception.
But after they have laid down this platform, ask them
if the salvation of children depends on being baptized,
and they will say, nay. Ask them if the heathen
can be saved without baptism, and they will give
an evasive answer.</p>

<p>I spoke in several of the towns on the National
road, between Richmond and Indianapolis, and generally
had fair congregations. In the latter place, the
capital of Indiana, I delivered several sermons in the
Court-house, but found only two families of the liberal
faith—C. Vanhouton and A. Longley. The latter
was doing business in town, and preaching in the
neighboring villages on Sundays. He still resides in
Indiana, and is still preaching the gospel. He is a
worthy man, and a sincere and devout Christian.
He has been a minister of the gospel about forty
years. My horse being lame, Mr. Vanhouton furnished
a colt, that had never been rode, in its stead;
but I soon broke him, and he carried me on my mission
very pleasantly. When I returned him, five
months afterwards, he jumped with delight. I love
a horse, love to ride and take care of him. He is a
noble animal, and merits kind treatment from man.
But he is often savagely abused. I always want to
kick the fellow, who ill treats a horse. He has a bad
heart.</p>

<p>I lectured in Greencastle several days. A Methodist
minister, desiring to know more about our faith,
questioned me thus:</p>

<p>“Do you believe in the Trinity?”</p>

<p>“No; I believe in one God, and no more.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the person of Christ?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“He was a created, subordinate, and dependent
being; the Son of God, the Son of man.”</p>

<p>“For how many did he die?”</p>

<p>“He tasted death for <em>every man</em>,—‘Gave himself a
ransom for <em>all</em>.’”</p>

<p>“Did he make a vicarious atonement?”</p>

<p>“No. He came to teach us that God is our Father,
Judge and Savior; that we are immortal beings,
shall live forever, and that we should love God, and
our fellow men.”</p>

<p>“But did he not come to reconcile God to the
world?”</p>

<p>“It was the mission of Jesus to reconcile man to
God, by the influence of truth, and his own noble
example. God is right, man is wrong, and Jesus
preached, lived and died, to advance man in all things
pure and good—to make man Godlike, and hence it
is said, that ‘God is in Christ reconciling the world
to himself.’”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in experimental religion?”</p>

<p>“Religion does no good unless we individually
experience its blessings. It is not an abstraction, a
speculation, but a <em>reality</em>, something to be known,
felt, experienced; it is a <em>life</em>.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in conversion?”</p>

<p>“Yes; conversion from error to truth, from sin to
holiness, from depravity to purity, from a disloyal to
a loyal life. But this conversion begins, progresses
and is consummated in perfect harmony with the laws
of the mind. It is as natural a process as is the
growth of the body.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in a hell?”</p>

<p>“The word hell in the Bible has several distinct
signification. 1st. It often means the grave. 2d.
Temporal destruction. 3d. Moral degradation. 4th.
The state of the dead. But hell in no sense is endless
in duration.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in a general judgment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“In a <em>general</em> and <em>everlasting</em> judgment. All are
now judged by the eternal laws of God, and we rise
or fall, are happy or miserable, as we obey or disobey
them. This judgment is also everlasting. Through
all time, and through all eternity, happiness will
result from obeying the laws of God, and misery from
disobeying them. Entering the spirit world, will not
change our natures, and the laws of the Creator are
the same there as here.”</p>

<p>“But do you not believe in a day of judgment?”</p>

<p>“Yes; in a day and in days of judgment. Judgment
commenced six thousand years ago, and it is
not yet closed. ‘All God’s ways are judgment,’ the
Bible teaches us. Particular calamities befalling nations
and cities, are called judgment days. The gospel
dispensation is termed a judgment day.”</p>

<p>“But do you not believe in a judgment day at the
end of time, when the immortal destiny of each of
Adam’s race will be immutably fixed for eternal weal
or woe?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I can find no reason, or philosophy, or
scripture for such a notion. The destiny of each
individual will not be determined at the end of time,
but it was determined in the purpose of God from all
eternity. Man is immortal, and is destined to become
more and more Godlike, intellectually and morally,
as the eternal ages roll along.”</p>

<p>“Are wicked men punished?”</p>

<p>“In the language of the Bible, I believe, that ‘He
that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong he hath
done, and there is no respect of persons.’ ‘Though
hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished.’
‘God is not mocked; whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap. He that soweth to the
flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.’”</p>

<p>“You deny though, everlasting punishment.”</p>

<p>“I believe in everlasting punishment in the Bible
sense of the word, but not in the present popular<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
sense. Punishment is as lasting as sin; but the Bible
no where teaches that sin and wrong are immortal.”</p>

<p>“How long do you suppose punishment will continue?”</p>

<p>“I know not how long. If you can inform me
how long men will be corruptible, earthy, sensual, I
will tell you how long they will suffer.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that in the other world all will be
equally happy?”</p>

<p>“There will, doubtless, be different degrees of purity,
virtue and happiness, on the other side of the
grave. There must be a moral connection between
this life and the life to come. As we end here we
shall begin there. Character belongs to the soul, and
the death of the body will not make a wise man of a
fool, or a saint of a sinner.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in the resurrection of the body?”</p>

<p>“I believe in the resurrection of <em>man</em>, the <em>inner
man</em>, that which now lives, thinks, and acts, but not
of the body, these bones and muscles, this flesh and
blood. This body connects the spirit with the material
world, but when it shall be withdrawn from this
outer sphere, and live wholly in the interior world, it
will have no farther use of this physical frame. It
will be clothed there with a body adapted to that
heavenly home.”</p>

<p>“Where is heaven?”</p>

<p>“Heaven is not a <em>place</em>, but a <em>condition</em>—a condition
of wisdom, purity, holiness. Heaven reigns in
that soul, which is loyal to God. There is a difference
between heaven and the spirit world. The latter
is a <em>place</em>—it may be boundless space. Men may
exist in that world without knowing much of heaven,
as they do exist in this world without much heavenly
mindedness.”</p>

<p>“Well, you entertain curious views. I do not see
how you can reconcile them with the Bible.”</p>

<p>I journeyed on to Terre Haute, where I delivered<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
several discourses. This was then a pleasant village,
but now it is a large and flourishing town, and one of
the most beautiful places in the West. Its spacious
streets, flanked on each side by trees, shrubbery,
lawns, flower gardens and elegant dwellings, give it a
charming appearance. It stands on the east bank of
the Wabash river, and on the margin of a rich and
beautiful prairie. Subsequently a society was organized,
and a meeting-house built, but for various reasons,
which I need not name, our cause, for many
years, has been in a feeble condition in that city. It
has recently revived under the auspices of the Northwest
Conference, and an able minister, H. Jewell, is
settled in the place. I rode to Vincennes, seventy
miles down the river, and preached in several villages
and neighborhoods, in not one of which the
doctrine of the Restitution had before been proclaimed.
The people generally attended my meetings, but
I found but few believers in the Great Salvation.</p>

<p>Returning to Terre Haute, I went up the Wabash
river, and preached in Clinton, Eugene, Perryville,
Attica, and West Point, places I have often since visited.
The religious principles I advocated were new
to nearly all the inhabitants of the Wabash Valley,
where I was traveling. There was here and there a
believer, but nearly all the people knew nothing of
Universalism. “Why,” said a man to me, “you do
not believe in the Bible, do you?” When I informed
him that I did, he was much astonished; and he was
perfectly amazed when he was told that I found my
faith in the Good Book. “I don’t know what you
preach for,” said he, “if all will be saved; and as to
praying, of course, you don’t pray.” This man’s
knowledge of our faith was the knowledge nearly all
the people of that region had of it. I was regarded
as an infidel, a wolf, a blasphemer, an emissary of
Satan. Women crossed the street when they saw me
coming, as if I was a walking pestilence; children<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
passed me as if they were afraid, and men looked
suspicious when they came in contact with me. But
it was not thus with all—far from it. Most of those
I met with, though they knew nothing of Universalism,
treated me kindly, and listened respectfully to
what I had to say.</p>

<p>I spent one month in Lafayette and Dayton, places
seven miles apart. A Methodist clergyman, by the
name of Smith, attended my first meeting in Lafayette,
and gave notice that he would reply in the
evening, and invited me to attend and reply to him
if I saw proper. Each of us spoke several times, but
I was far from being satisfied with my defense. I
considered it a failure, though my friends seemed to
think I did well. Mr. Smith was a pretty sharp man,
an experienced preacher, and accustomed to speaking
without preparation. He knew he had the advantage
of me, and so followed me up for several Sabbaths,
and seemed determined to drive me out of the country,
or shut my mouth. We had five distinct encounters,
and in the outcome he got the worst of it, for he
spent his strength in the beginning of the contest,
while I grew stronger as the discussion progressed.
Two years after I located in Lafayette, organized a
society, commenced the publication of <cite>The Christian
Teacher</cite>, and several years after a meeting-house was
erected. In the interim of the discussions with Mr.
Smith, I preached in Dayton. Here a school teacher
tried two or three times to demolish me, but I survived
his attacks. I found some excellent friends in
this place, a society was formed, and a few years after
a temple was erected.</p>

<p>Preaching, debating, conversation, visiting and riding,
occupied nearly all my time, and what reading I
did was chiefly on horseback. If I had five or fifty
miles to ride, I improved the occasion by reading
some useful book. I would pass travelers and farm-houses
unnoticed. I recollect, after spending a day<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
in riding and reading, I put up at a farm-house, and
told the good woman I wanted no meat, tea or coffee
for supper. “What do you want?” said she, with
amazement. “A little bread and milk, if you please,
and a whole candle, as I wish to write this evening.”
The candle was furnished, a pig’s face, a cold hoe-cake,
and a bowl of sour milk. She went to the
neighboring village, Martinsville, and reported that
there was a crazy man at her house.</p>

<p>Proceeding on my journey, with book in hand,
I rode to Logansport, where I lectured twice. Have
preached there often since. We have now an elegant
meeting-house in this pleasant and flourishing town,
built by a bequest of Colonel Pollard, who for many
years was a prominent merchant of the place. He
will long be remembered with gratitude for his noble
gift. Though dead he yet speaks. Men of wealth,
in disposing of their possessions, would do well to
remember religious societies, benevolent and literary
institutions, and those tried and faithful men who
have grown gray in the service of humanity. Such
men devote their time and talent to the world, and
old age often finds them poor in this world’s goods.
Let the rich, when dying, consider them, and the
cause for which they have given their all.</p>

<p>Near Plymouth were congregated six hundred Pottowattamie
Indians, preliminary to moving them to
the distant West. I spent several hours with them.
Asked the chief where they were going. “I don’t
know.” “Do you wish to remain here?” “Oh yes,
oh yes. I leave the bones of my fathers here; but
where will my bones, and those of my children be
laid? No matter, no matter. The Indians are
doomed.” A father and mother buried their child
with their own hands. Not a word was uttered, not
a tear was shed. “Lo, the poor Indian!” In a few
more years the sun will rise on the last original owner
of our national domain. Our swords and our vices<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
have been doing their work of death ever since the
Indians welcomed the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock,
and they are rising in judgment and condemning us.
It seems to be a law of nature, that a subjugated people
must either blend with their conquerors or be annihilated.
The Indians will not unite with us, and
destruction is their doom. The weak, if they attempt
to stand alone, fall. Their only chance of salvation
is in the alliance of the strong.</p>

<p>Lectured in Laporte and Door village, and then proceeded
to Michigan City, where I also held meetings.
I also spoke in South Bend. A Presbyterian clergyman
opened his battery on me from his pulpit, which
has been called the coward’s castle. He said Universalism
was false for the following reasons: 1st, It
conflicts with the justice of God; 2d, With the mercy
of God; 3d, With the love of God; 4th, With
reason; 5th, With sound philosophy; 6th, With the
law of God; 7th, With the gospel of Jesus Christ;
8th, With the Bible doctrine of sin; 9th, Of punishment;
10th, Of faith; 11th, Of rewards; 12th, Of
heaven; 13th, Of hell; 14th, Because it is a new
doctrine; 15th, The devil’s doctrine; 16th, A wicked
doctrine; 17th, A licentious doctrine; 18th,
Wicked men and devils preach it. I replied to his
long tirade. Our people now have a society, meeting-house,
and a settled minister in South Bend.
There is also a society and meeting-house four miles
from there, at Mount Pleasant.</p>

<p>I pursued my weary way, on horseback, to Chicago,
through swamps, over sand ridges, fighting
mosquitoes, fleas, gnats and bedbugs. I used to
think in those days that the region between Michigan
City and Chicago was abandoned in disgust ere it
was half finished. And the few inhabitants on the
route were on a par with the country. They lived in
a wretched manner, in log cabins on sand ridges, surrounded
by swamps and stagnant pools. Since then,<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
railroads have improved the country and the people.
Spent three weeks in Chicago, and preached three
Sabbaths in an old court-house to large congregations.
Chicago then contained about five thousand inhabitants,
and was rather a hard looking place. There
were no bridges across the river, no paved streets, no
railroads, and but little business was done, and its
citizens did not dream of the splendid career that was
awaiting their humble town. I found some zealous
friends of our cause, but there was no organization,
and they had never held regular meetings. While I
was there, I visited most of the Universalist families,
and was urged to settle in Chicago, but I told my
friends that it was my mission “to go into all the
world and preach the gospel to every creature.”</p>

<p>Leaving Chicago, I turned my horse towards Cincinnati,
and passed through Logansport, Lafayette,
and Indianapolis. I would ride all day and deliver a
long discourse at night. Returned to Cincinnati the
last of December, after an absence of six months;
and during that time I had traveled twelve hundred
miles—all on horseback—delivered one hundred
and ten discourses, and received for compensation,
one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>In a few days I commenced a journey through
Ohio on my ever faithful horse. Lectured in Mason
on temperance. I have seen the blasting effects of
rum drinking, but neither my body or my soul was
ever polluted by a glass of distilled liquor. Cannot
distinguish the different kinds of spirits, and have no
inclination to know more about them. Rum selling,
and rum drinking, are abominations that make desolate
the hearts and homes of multitudes; and it is
amazing that sensible men will rush headlong to
destruction with the bottle in their hands and their
eyes wide open. The guilty parties in this wretched
business are, 1st, The manufacturers; 2d, The sellers;
3d, The drinkers; 4th, The authorities that
license the traffic; 5th, The communities who empower
the authorities to license. Most of the people
are guilty, and all suffer more or less, directly or indirectly.
But let the friends of temperance labor in
season and out of season, to reform the people, and
banish the curse from the land. Their noble work
will not be in vain; God will crown it with success.
I also delivered several sermons near Edwardsville.
General Baldwin resided near there—a reliable
friend of liberal principles. He was an intelligent<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
and influential man, and devoted to our cause. He
was one of the first to make an effort to establish
Universalism in Southern Ohio. Although a layman
he often spoke in public in its defense. Subsequently
he moved to Illinois; but he carried his religion
and zeal with him. He died full of years, and went
down to an honored grave.</p>

<p>Spoke in Columbus on religion, and delivered a
discourse against the death penalty. Universalism
repudiates the taking of life. It is wrong for an individual
to kill a man; it is wrong for a state to kill a
man. But taking of life may sometimes be justifiable.
Is this a contradiction? A wretch enters my
house at midnight, and attempts to murder my family.
Either he must be disabled, or he will kill the
whole household. In attempting to disable him I
take his life. Am I not justified, although I have
violated the command, “Thou shalt not kill?” An
army marches through the land, and takes provisions
for man and beast, without permission of the owners.
Are they not justified, although they have violated
the command, “Thou shalt not steal?” A vessel
enters a port laden with food; the inhabitants are
starving, but the owner refuses to sell or give to the
starving citizens. Are they not justified in helping
themselves, although in doing so they commit theft?
They must either steal or die; and of the two evils
they choose the least. It is wrong to steal, but it is
a greater wrong to die if one can avoid it. So it is
wrong to kill a man, but a greater wrong is committed
when an assassin kills an innocent man. But
when a murderer is in custody, the safety of no one
requires that his life shall be taken. Put him in
prison, and keep him there till he becomes a safe man
in the community, and if he never reforms, keep him
there for life.</p>

<p>The world’s mode of dealing with offenders is radically
wrong; there is too much of the leaven of<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
revenge in it. They should be treated as morally
insane, rather than as criminals. Our penitentiaries
should be converted into moral reform schools, and
transgressors should be put there, and retained there,
till well qualified persons, who scrutinize their conduct
every day, pronounce them regenerated. And
he, who may be sent there for stealing one dollar,
should remain there till he is no longer a thief, and if
he resists all efforts to reform him, keep him there as
long as he lives. It is better for him, and for society,
that he should be thus excluded from the world.
Man has no right to <em>punish</em> his brother man; God
has established laws, and if they are violated punishment
is sure to follow; and it is our duty to reform
the erring. This mode of treatment accords with the
gospel, and the spirit of Christ, but the penitentiary,
the gallows, and the guillotine, correspond with the
spirit of Orthodoxy.</p>

<p>When a great crime is committed our blood boils,
and we cry aloud for vengeance; but a little correct
reflection on such occasions will do us no harm. The
criminal inherited a bad moral organization, and was,
perhaps, surrounded by evil associates from the cradle
to manhood. All this should be considered in
dealing with the fallen; but the law of man sees it
not, considers it not. He is deemed equally as blamable
as his associate in crime, who was brought up
under the most favorable circumstances. But there
is a great difference between the criminality of the
two. The latter sins against much more light than
the former, and is a greater criminal in the sight of
God. Most of offenders come into this world “half
made up,” and are educated in crime from infancy
upward. Let the state take them under its special
care and keeping; protect society from their depredations,
and strive to make better men and women of
such unfortunates.</p>

<p>Preached in Newark and Zanesville. In the former<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
place a preacher deemed it his duty to oppose me,
but he did it in a very gentlemanly manner. The
subject of my discourse was <em>hell</em>, and the following
was the gist of it: 1st. The Bible no where asserts
that hell is beyond the grave, and in the immortal
world. On the contrary, it teaches that it is on the
earth. The lawgiver, Moses, locates it here. “For
a fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn unto the
<em>lowest hell</em>, and shall consume the earth with her
increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
I will heap mischief upon them; I will spend
my arrows upon them. They shall be burned with
hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with
bitter destruction; I will also send the teeth of beasts
upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy
both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also
with the man of gray hairs. I said, I would scatter
them into corners, I would make the remembrance of
them to cease from among men. To me belongeth
vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in
due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
and the things that shall come upon them make
haste.” Moses here tells his countrymen what would
be the consequences if they should be unfaithful to
the trust committed to them. The Lord would “hide
his face from them,” “vengeance would overtake
them,” “the day of their calamity would be at
hand,” “they would be scattered into all parts of the
earth,” “the sword without and terror within would
destroy them,” they would be “burnt with hunger.”
All these calamities are expressed by the words,
“<em>lowest hell</em>;” and the history of that remarkable
nation shows that the prophecy has been fulfilled.
That nation has been cast down to the lowest hell.
David testifies that the results of sin are not far off.
“The pains of hell <em>got hold</em> of me; I <em>found trouble</em>
and <em>sorrow</em>.” Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees,<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
“Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can
ye escape the damnation of hell.” Matt. xxiii. 33.
And then he adds, “All these things shall come upon
<em>this generation</em>.” 2d. Hell is no where in the Bible
said to be endless; and who has a right to assume
that it is endless in duration? Popes, bishops and
councils have threatened the world with endless torment,
if it did not bow to their yoke, but thank God
our destiny is not in their hands. 3d. We have no
information of the creation of such a place as Orthodoxy
proclaims. We read of God creating the heavens
and the earth, and all therein, but not a word
about his building a vast prison in which to torment
countless millions of his creatures world without end.
It is blasphemy to charge the God of love with such
work. God is good, and all his works are good.
When creation was finished all things were pronounced
<em>good</em>. An eternal hell then is no part of God’s
work. Let this be remembered. 4th. The New
Testament never speaks of any one being saved from
hell. It was the mission of Jesus to save us from
<em>sin</em>, from <em>darkness</em>, from a <em>lost condition</em>, from <em>slavery</em>,
from the <em>present evil world</em>, but there is not an intimation
in the New Testament that God sent his Son
to save us from a hell of his own creating. 5th. The
word hell in the Bible does not signify, according to
good authority, a place of ceaseless woe. Dr. Adam
Clarke, the well known commentator, says: “The
word <em>hell</em>, used in the common translation, conveys
<em>now</em> an improper meaning of the original word; because
<em>hell</em> is only used to signify the place of the
damned. But as the word <em>hell</em> comes from the
Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang">helan</i>, to <em>cover</em>, to <em>hide</em>, hence the <em>tyling</em>
or <em>slating</em> of a house is called, in some parts of England,
(particularly Cornwall,) <em>heling</em>, to this day;
and the <em>covers of books</em>, (in Lancashire,) by the same
name.” This admission is fatal to the common
received views of hell. 6th. The word hell in the<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
Old Testament, is taken from the Hebrew term <i lang="he">sheol</i>,
and learned men of all schools admit, that it signifies
the state of the dead in general, without regard to
their condition. Dr. George Campbell remarks as
follows: “<i lang="he">Sheol</i> in itself considered, has no connection
with future punishment.” Dr. Whitby, a profound
English scholar tells us, that “<i lang="he">Sheol</i> throughout
the Old Testament signifies not a place of punishment,
or of the souls of bad men only, but the grave
only, or the place of the dead.” Other critics admit
the same. 7th. In the New Testament, the word hell
is translated from the Greek term <i lang="grc">hades</i>, and as that
is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew <i lang="he">sheol</i>, its meaning
is the same as its corresponding word. Hence
Dr. Campbell says, “<i lang="grc">Hades</i> occurs eleven times in
the New Testament, and is rendered grave once, and
hell ten times. In my judgment, it ought never in
Scripture to be rendered hell, at least in the sense
wherein that word is universally understood by Christians.
In the Old Testament the corresponding word
is <i lang="he">sheol</i>, which signifies the state of the dead in general,
without regard to the goodness or badness of the
persons, their happiness or misery. It is very plain
that neither in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament,
nor in the New, does the word <i lang="grc">hades</i> convey
the meaning which the present English word hell, in
the Christian usage, always conveys to our minds.
The attempt to illustrate this would be unnecessary,
as it is hardly now pretended by any critic that this is
the acception of the term in the Old Testament.”
8th. The word hell in the New Testament in twelve
instances, is taken from the Greek term <i lang="grc">gehenna</i>, and
Orthodox scholars thus define that word: “<i lang="he">Gehenna</i>
is a Hebrew word denoting a place near Jerusalem,
in which the Israelites, giving themselves up to idolatry,
sacrificed children to a heated image of Moloch,
which represented the form of an ox. This place, the
valley of Hinnom, the Jews afterwards so detested,<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
that they were accustomed to cast into it the unburied
carcasses of those whom they desired to punish with
unusual severity. It is called a <em>gehenna of fire</em>, because
Josiah, in order to render the valley of Hinnom
more odious, commanded that filth and dead carcasses
should be cast into it; for the burning of which there
was kept a perpetual fire.” 2 Kings xxiii. 10, et seq.
This is the testimony of Dr. Rosenmuller, and it
is the testimony of all the learned, belong to what
denomination they may. This is the literal meaning
of the word, twelve times rendered hell in the New
Testament. Figuratively, it refers to the temporal
desolation that was soon to befall the Jewish nation.
The damnation of <i lang="he">gehenna</i> overwhelmed Jerusalem,
the whole land, and the people. Jesus told his countrymen
that they had filled up the measure of their
iniquity, that the vials of wrath and fiery indignation
were about to be poured upon them, that on them
would come all the righteous blood their nation had
spilt. When these things shall come to pass, said
Jesus, “there shall be great tribulation, such as was
not since the beginning of the world to this time.”
He told them over and over, that all these things
would come on that generation. Theologians now
locate all that in yonder world. They might as well
assert, that the Ohio valley is the name of a place beyond
the grave, and the destruction that befell the
Indians therein is immortal woe in a <i lang="la">post mortem</i> hell.</p>

<p>The gentleman said I was partly right and partly
wrong. I met him several years after, and he was
then preaching the <em>annihilation</em> of the wicked. He
had made some progress, for it is certainly better to
burn men to ashes than to burn them forever. I lectured
in McConnersville, and became acquainted with
Mrs. Frances Gage, who since then has been before
the public as a writer and lecturer on temperance and
woman’s rights. Notwithstanding her limited education,
she writes good poetry and prose, and is a superior<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
lecturer. She is a noble woman, and devotes
her life to noble purposes. Spent several days in
Marietta, a beautiful town on the Ohio river. I was
urged to remain there, and the society offered me five
hundred dollars per year, a liberal salary for the
times, but I declined. I was fearful that I could not
sustain myself in preaching at one place all the time.
The friends there had no idea but I could, but I
fancied that I knew myself better than they did.
Preached in Belpre. Stopped with General Putnam,
a descendent of the revolutionary hero of that
name—a splendid man, and a devoted believer in
the restitution of all things. Here I also met with
W. H. Jolly, an early pioneer preacher. He traveled
most of the time through the wilderness of Ohio,
preaching in private houses, school-houses, barns, and
wherever he could have a hearing. He received but
a small compensation, his whole soul was in the work,
and he was dearly beloved by his fellow believers.
He died soon after I saw him, but he is still remembered
as a devoted and good man. He had a daughter,
a young lady, who wrote well for our periodicals.
She afterwards married, and I do not know what has
become of her.</p>

<p>I preached in Richmond and Chillicothe. In the
former place the meetings caused considerable excitement,
which brought out a preacher against me. He
abused me, my faith, and every body that entertained
it. He was a regular blackguard, and a son of thunder.
My clothes being rather seedy, the friends, as a
compensation for my labor, presented me with a new
suit, and I went on my way rejoicing. A clergyman
of the liberal faith, by the name of Wood, resided
and preached in Richmond. He, however, soon after
left there, moved to Patriot, Ind., ceased to preach,
was, for one or two sessions, a member of the Indiana
Legislature, and finally died insane. He was a worthy
man, but was too easily discouraged to be a minister<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
in the West in those days. Delivered lectures
in several places in Highland county. Became acquainted
with a brother by the name of Webber,
who soon after commenced preaching. After laboring
about ten years in Ohio, he moved to Scotland
county, Mo., where he died, after traveling and
preaching in that state two or three years. His lone
grave is on the wide and wild prairie. The last time
I saw it a frail fence enclosed his resting place, and
that, ere this, has probably disappeared.</p>

<p>I returned to Cincinnati May, 1839. Had been
absent five months, delivered ninety-three discourses,
and traveled six hundred miles. The succeeding
nine months were spent in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
Delivered a series of discourses in Warsaw,
Ky., which awakened much interest. Dr. Chamberlin,
a wealthy and influential citizen of that place,
had recently embraced the better faith. He had been
a member of the Campbellite church, and all who
knew him, freely admitted that his new faith had
made a new man of him. It expanded his soul, and
opened his hand and his purse. His wealth, time
and talent, and the latter was of a superior order, were
devoted to the upbuilding of the truth. He distributed
hundreds of volumes of our denominational books
through Kentucky, and was ever ready to aid every
effort to advance the good cause. He subsequently
moved to Burlington, Iowa, donated to every Universalist
society in Iowa one hundred and sixty acres of
land, and, I think, gave the Lombard College, in
Galesburg, Ill., ten thousand dollars in cash, besides
many valuable books and a collection of American
antiquities. Lectured three times in Lexington, Ky.
One of the ministers in town delivered a philippic
against the new faith; said Universalism was a species
of infidelity. I asked, what is there infidel about
it? It asserts, that there a God, who rules in heaven
and on earth, and in who we live, move and have our<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
being. Is that infidelity? It teaches that Jesus
Christ is the Son of God, and Savior of the world.
Is that infidelity? It declares that God will surely
and fully reward every virtue, and surely and fully
punish every vice. Is that infidelity? It proclaims
that man is an immortal being, and destined to advance
onward and upward forever and ever. Is that
infidelity? It asserts, that our greatest happiness
consists in communing with God, and leading a pure
and virtuous life. Is that infidelity? Portions of
your system, sir, are worse than infidelity. You are
a Calvinist, and in the language of John Wesley,
“You may call me an infidel, a Turk, a Mahomedan,
but don’t call me a Calvinist. I had rather believe
in no God than believe he is an <em>almighty tyrant</em>.”
You believe in a burning hell in which God will
plunge most of the dead, to be his victims eternally.
Is there any thing in the baldest infidelity half as
infernal as that? You believe that God creates us all
totally depraved, not capable of thinking a good
thought or performing a good act, and if we do not
change our nature, he will roast us in hell forever.
And then to cap the climax of infamy, you teach that
God decreed from all eternity, that the victims of perdition
should be born totally depraved, should live a
wicked life, and in the end should fall into the bottomless
pit. If your creed is <em>religion</em>, give me <em>infidelity</em>.
To exchange the latter for the former, would
be exchanging heaven for hell.</p>

<p>I also lectured several times near Lexington, at the
request of a venerable man by the name of Taylor, a
relative of President Taylor. Several years after, I
heard Dr. Young, a Methodist minister, tell the following
story in his pulpit at St. Louis, about Mr.
Taylor and an imaginary clergyman: “There lived
an old and rich man near Lexington, Ky., by the
name of Taylor, who was a Universalist. Some time
since, he sent to Cincinnati for a preacher of his<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
choice to come and preach for him, and the preacher
having performed his labor, Mr. T. paid him one hundred
dollars. All right; preachers should be paid
for their work like other folks. Some time after, the
preacher visited him again, by Mr. T.’s request, and
he again paid him one hundred dollars. He did
right,” added Dr. Young. “When the preacher was
about departing, he told the old man he needed five
hundred dollars, and would be much obliged if Mr.
Taylor would lend him that sum for a short time.
He lent it to him, and to this day the debt has not
been cancelled. The old man renounced his Universalism,
and died a Methodist. If any of you doubt
the truth of this story, I tell you it is as true as the
gospel, for I know all about it.” I called on the
gentleman the next day and asked him if he was acquainted
with Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you know any of his relatives?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But you said yesterday that you knew all about
this matter.”</p>

<p>“Brother Kavanagh told it to me, and he learned
it from a brother in Kentucky.”</p>

<p>“Now, sir, I knew Mr. Taylor, and I suppose that
I am the preacher you referred to, and I pronounce
the whole story, save that Mr. T. was a Universalist,
and that I preached in his neighborhood, <em>false</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this took place a <em>long time ago, before your
day</em>.”</p>

<p>I took occasion to lecture him for telling slanderous
tales about the living or the dead on mere hearsay.
Mr. Taylor took me to Richmond, where I spoke
twice. Two men came to me at the close of one of
the meetings; their hearts were full. They thanked
God that the scales had fallen from their eyes, and
that they beheld the gospel in all its heavenly beauty.
I also preached in Paris, Flemingsburg, and many<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
other places in Kentucky. In one place, I remember
that in the middle of a sermon I had a hard ague
chill, and had to stop half an hour, when I resumed
my discourse.</p>

<p>The new meeting-house in Patriot, Ind., was to be
dedicated, and a large party of Cincinnatians employed
a boat to take them down and back. It was
a delightful excursion. We had music and dancing,
talking and promenading. George Rogers and E. M.
Pingree were of the party—both are now in heaven,
I trust. We three did the preaching. J. L. Johnson
was installed pastor of the church. He had been a
Methodist, his faith was now enlarged, but he retained
many of his old notions, and all his Orthodox
phraseology, and consequently he had poor success.
He soon left us and returned to his mother church.
About this time I attended a discussion in New Richmond,
Ohio, between Robert Smith, and a Mr. Fisher,
a Methodist layman. Mr. F. was an able man, and
better qualified to defend his cause than three fourths
of the preachers of his order. Both being strong
men, the discussion was very interesting. Daniel
Parker resided there, and had long been in the ministry.
He called himself a Restorationist, and would
not associate with Universalists. I suppose his views
corresponded with those of Elhanan Winchester.
He was a disorganizer, would not form societies, but
was a very sincere, devout and good man. He
preached one evening, and in the midst of his sermon
he buried his face in his hands, and wept like a child.
I recollect that he said in his sermon, that he had
never believed in Universalism one minute in all his
life. In his old age, I have understood, he joined the
Baptist church.</p>

<p>My health continued feeble, not having recovered
from the ague engendered in the South, but it did not
confine me in-doors a day. I had a slight chill every
day, succeeded by an inward fever, which kept me in<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
a debilitated condition. Occasionally though I had a
violent <em>shake</em>. Often when riding, I would have an
attack of the ague, when I would stop two or three
hours, and then resume my journey. I took all sorts
of medicines, but nothing did me any good. It finally
occurred to me that breakfast might have some
connection with my ague, as it returned every morning
soon after eating. I refrained from partaking of
breakfast for a week, and the ague did not trouble
me. Two or three times afterwards my morning
ague returned, but abstaining from breakfast always
prevented a relapse. I was soon entirely free from
it, and since then, with the exception of two attacks
of bilious fever, one in St. Louis, and one in Chicago,
brought on in both cases by walking and riding
in the blazing sun, and preaching too much, I have
enjoyed perfect health. I certainly have reason to be
thankful for the good health I have enjoyed, and for
innumerable other blessings, temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>George Rogers had traveled in the Southern states,
and was urged either to return or send some one to
preach to the people. He could not go, and at his
solicitation, I consented to journey in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North and
South Carolina; and from thence I purposed going by
sea to Boston, Mass. February, 1840, with horse and
buggy, I started from Cincinnati on what I expected
would be a long and hard journey, through a thinly
settled region, and among strangers. Crossed the
Ohio river, and traveled about ten miles on a splendid
pike. But at the end of the pike the sublime and
ridiculous joined hands. Horse and buggy plunged
from the hard, dry and smooth road into an ocean of
mud and water. This enlightened me concerning the
condition of the roads generally, and after floundering
in the mud awhile, I succeeded in getting back to dry
land, and returned to Cincinnati, and abandoned my
contemplated southern journey.</p>

<p>I then resolved to go East through Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New York and Massachusetts, and in a few<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
days after I recrossed the Ohio river, I was on my
way, on horseback, to the noted city of Boston. I
performed the whole journey, about one thousand
miles, on horseback, and it occupied six weeks. I
went East to visit my mother, and hurried through as
fast as possible. But I could not travel very fast, as
the roads were in a bad condition, and the weather
was often stormy. Preached in Woodstock, to large
assemblies. Spent three days very pleasantly in visiting
kind friends, and in talking to the people. A
society was subsequently formed and a meeting-house
erected. Cyrus F. Wait, then a youth, attended my
meetings. He soon after commenced preaching, and
labored faithfully in the ministry till 1865, when he
laid down his armor and ascended to his God. He
lived and labored in Woodstock most of the time he
was in the ministry, was an efficient preacher and an
excellent man. I delivered several sermons in Delaware,
and had the following conversation with a Baptist
clergyman:</p>

<p>“You preached in town last night, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you are right, I cannot be wrong.”</p>

<p>“If I am right in my religious views, you are radically
wrong in yours, for I expect we essentially differ.
If my views of God, Christ, heaven, hell, man,
rewards and punishments, are correct, you are in
error, of course, wherein you differ from me. Any
one with half an eye, and that nearly out, can see
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am safe if Universalism is true.”</p>

<p>“You are in a lost condition if it is true. He only
is safe whose life is in harmony with the truth. Your
mind, I perceive, from your conversation, is darkened
by a false theology. ‘Know the truth,’ said Jesus,
‘and the truth shall make you free.’ ‘Sanctify them
through thy truth, thy word is truth.’ Jesus attached
great importance to receiving the truth. You are<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
walking in darkness, and see that you do not stumble.
Truth is a lamp to the feet, and a guide to the soul.
We cannot walk safely without that light.”</p>

<p>“But I shall be saved as well as you if Universalism
is of God.”</p>

<p>“You will be saved when your soul shall be sanctified
by the truth, and not till then. Universalism
promises no salvation, in this world or the world to
come, without purity of heart. Let that be remembered.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you believed we should all be saved
any how.”</p>

<p>“You thought wrong. There is only one way to
be saved, and that is, by having our souls baptized
with the truth. Those thus baptized <em>are saved</em>, heaven
now reigns in their souls, the kingdom of God,
which is righteousness, joy and peace in the Holy
Spirit, is <em>within them</em>. That is the salvation Jesus
lived, labored and died to bless man with.”</p>

<p>Delivered a discourse in Circleville, and formed the
acquaintance of W. Y. Emmett. He has long been
known in Ohio as a faithful minister of the New Testament.
His father was a Methodist clergyman, but
the son has greatly improved on the theology of the
father. There are three steps from extreme error, in
religion, to truth—Calvinism, Arminianism, Universalism.
Perhaps Br. Emmett’s grand-father was a
Calvinist. Passing on, I lectured several times in
Ashtabula, but sectarianism taking alarm, all doors
were closed against me, and I proceeded to Conneautville.
Ammi Bond resided there. He has recently
died. His ministry was confined, chiefly, to the
northeast part of Ohio, and to contiguous portions of
Pennsylvania. His personal appearance was attractive;
had a well formed head, a Grecian face, and
the soul within corresponded with the outer man.
From here I proceeded more rapidly on my journey.
Called on A. B. Grosh, Utica, N. Y., who was then<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
publishing <cite>The Gospel Advocate</cite>. He possesses fine
ability, and is, every way, a noble man. Crossed the
Hudson river, at Troy, and after six weeks traveling
reached Princeton, Mass., where my mother resided.
Visited my old home in Haverhill, and shed a tear
over my brother’s grave in Plaistow, N. H., attended
a Conference meeting in Boston, and then sailed from
Boston for Philadelphia, in the brig Mary Ann, commanded
by Captain Chase. We encountered a tremendous
storm—an equinoctial storm—which made
the vessel roll and plunge at a fearful rate, and set the
sailors to telling stories of shipwrecks, ghosts, and
home. The captain, who was a member of one of
our societies on Cape Cod, related the following of a
Methodist preacher:—The previous season there was
a terrible storm off that coast, and many vessels were
lost. A friend of his, who ran a vessel between New
York and Boston, was out in it, and during the hardest
of the gale, in a pitch-black night, he was trying
to weather Cape Cod, to get into a sheltered position.
He had a Methodist preacher on board. About midnight,
when it was dark as Egypt, the wind howling,
the waves dashing, and the vessel plunging, he
went into the cabin dripping with salt water, when
the preacher said, “Captain, how are we getting
along?” The captain replied, “We are drifting
towards the shore very fast, and we shall all be in
heaven before morning.” “God <em>forbid</em>,” said the
clergyman. This reminds me of a courageous preacher
in Indiana. Some boatmen, after toiling all night
in a flat-boat on White river, tied up their craft, and
sought a place to rest. They selected a barn for that
purpose. Over its floor was a scaffold covered with
hay, on which they laid their weary bodies to repose.
Being much fatigued they slept sound and long.
When they awoke, they found that there was a congregation
worshiping on the floor below, for it was
Sunday morning. The preacher was in the midst of<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
his theme—the judgment day, that day for which all
days were made. He had got to where the saints
were about to be raised, and he, of course, was one of
them. “O-ah,” said he, “I want to go-ah; I am
tired-ah of this wicked-ah world-ah;” and looking
straight at the roof of the barn, he cried as loud as he
could scream, “Gabriel-ah, Gabriel-ah, blow-ah that
trumpet-ah, that I-ah may leave-ah this ungodly-ah
world-ah, and go to heaven-ah. I-ah say-ah, Gabriel-ah,
blow-ah that-ah trumpet-ah this-ah minute-ah.”
The boatmen had a tin horn, and one gave a loud
blast, which made every worshiper bound to his feet.
The preacher stopped short, cast one agonizing glance
upward, and then leaped through and over his flock
out of the barn, and ran home as fast as his legs would
carry him. One old lady, in her haste to get out of
the way of Gabriel, broke a limb.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia I was introduced to Asher Moore,
a well known minister in the East. Z. Fuller, for
many years an influential clergyman in that city, had
recently died. Being anxious to return to my western
field of labor, I tarried but a few hours in P.
Proceeded over the mountains to Pittsburg, by railroad
and stage, where I delivered several discourses.
From thence I went in a steamboat to Cincinnati;
and in a few days, was on the road to Chicago.</p>

<p>A journey to Chicago from Cincinnati was not as
easily, or as quickly made in those days as it is now.
Instead of a few hours, it took about two weeks of
hard traveling to perform the journey. Instead of a
smooth, iron road, it was about the roughest and softest
road ever traveled by man or beast. Parts of it
were railway, but the rails were unhewed logs, and
laid across the track, which endangered the horse’s
legs and carriage wheels. Portions of the year it was
hard to find the bottom of the mud. It was indeed a
rough and terrible road most of the way through;
and the driver had to keep both eyes open to avoid<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
stumps, holes and quagmires, and often with good
eyes, and they used to the best advantage, he did not
escape shipwreck. Preached in Richmond, Ind., four
times. This is a Quaker town. Had a long conversation
with a preacher of that order.</p>

<p>“You do not pray in public?”</p>

<p>“No; Christ enjoined secret prayer.”</p>

<p>“True; but he prayed in the presence of others,
and on the cross prayed in the presence of thousands,
‘Father, forgive them for they know not what they
do.’ The seventeenth chapter of John is a prayer
uttered in the presence of his disciples. The apostle
Paul, on one occasion, kneeled on the sea shore in the
midst of a large assembly, and vocally invoked the
divine blessing. And most of good men and good
women in all ages and in all climes, whether Christian
or Pagan, have sanctioned the practice. The tongue
loves to speak what the heart feels, and a prayer
straight from the heart, often has more influence on
an assembly than a good sermon. Of course, it is a
great sin to pray or preach ‘to be seen of men,’ but
praying and preaching with the spirit and the understanding,
are heaven-appointed means to christianize
the soul. There is, doubtless, much hypocritical
praying as well as preaching, but the abuse of a good
thing is not a valid reason for its abandonment. You
oppose singing, I understand. Why do you?”</p>

<p>“The Friends in their worship are governed by the
<em>spirit</em>, and singing is an <em>art</em>, <em>taught</em> and <em>learned</em>,
hence they exclude it from their worship.”</p>

<p>“Learning to <em>read</em> is an <em>art</em>, and yet you read the
Bible. Speaking correctly is an <em>art</em>, but you cultivate
correct speaking in your meetings. The <em>spirit</em>
does not teach you how to read or how to speak.
Music is a science of which God is the author, and in
studying music we learn of the wisdom of God, and
in singing we sing his praise. A good hymn sung
correctly is a sermon and a prayer; it unites the<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
hearts of all who hear, and stirs the soul to its depths.
Why do you all wear the same style of dress?”</p>

<p>“Because we abhor <em>fashions</em>.”</p>

<p>“But it seems to me that your people are great
lovers of fashion. There is a Quaker fashion, and
you all, men, women and children, stick to it through
thick and thin. If one of your members deviates
from your fashion he is dealt with as an offender.
You do not run after every fashion, but you adopt the
fashion of the times of Charles II., and will make no
improvement. I despise fashion more than you do,
for I consult my own taste, and not the frivolous
whims of crack-brains in the nineteenth or sixteenth
century.”</p>

<p>A gentleman here told me a singular story. A
physician and a lawyer lived in Richmond; they were
intimate friends, and spent much time together.
Both were zealous infidels, and they promised each
other, that the one that should die first, if he lived
after death, would return to his friend left on earth if
he was able to do so. The physician died, but the
survivor thought not of the promise, for he was sure
death had spared nothing of his friend. Several
months after the physician’s death, the lawyer was
astonished to see his departed friend enter his office.
He slowly approached the couch on which he was
lying, for it was night, and reminded him of their
mutual promise; said he had made several efforts
before to visit him but failed; told him that both of
them were mistaken about death; that <em>the man</em> did
not die; he only put off the body and entered on a
higher sphere of existence, and that most of mankind
were in error concerning the second stage of life, that
being much more like this world than many imagined.
After an affectionate adieu, he disappeared, promising
to return, if possible, but he saw him no more. The
gentleman related the circumstance to his friends,
and they, of course, laughed at him, and said he was<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
crazy or asleep, whereupon he went before a magistrate
and testified under oath, that what he related
was strictly correct. He was ever after a believer in
immortality; he said he <em>knew</em> there was a future life,
for he had seen one from the land beyond the vale.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Ohio related to me the following:
He ran a flouring mill, located at the foot of a hill, on
the top of which was his residence. His aged father
often spent an hour or two in the mill. One day he
observed him enter the building, with staff in hand,
and after remaining a few minutes, walked out.
Nothing was said by either party, and several times
they passed within three or four feet of each other.
Stepping to the door soon after the old gentleman
went out, he saw his father slowly ascending the hill
to the house. He immediately had occasion to go to
the house, and not seeing his father, inquired for him,
and was informed that he was lying down. He went
into his room and found him asleep, and was told he
had been on the bed a full hour.</p>

<p>Another intelligent friend related the following:
His family and another family occupied one house in
an Ohio town—the former the front, and the latter
the rear part of the building, and a gate, two
feet from the front door, was the entrance to the rear
of the house. The gate swung hard on its hinges,
and with much noise. About ten at night, my informant,
from his front door, observed a person on
the sidewalk approaching the house; having a peculiar
appearance, he requested his wife to step to the
door and see who it was. To both he seemed a
stranger, and both remarked that he made no noise
walking on the stone pavement. When opposite the
gate, and two feet from where they were standing, he
turned and passed through the gateway to the rear of
the building out of sight. Supposing the gate was
open, as the traveler did not stop to open it, the gentleman
stepped aside to close it, when, to his atonishment,<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
he found it shut. On opening the gate he
found that it made as loud a report, and required as
much effort as usual. Not being able to account for
all this, he inquired of his neighbor if any one had
called, and was answered, nay. That night a woman
in the rear part of the building died. It is quite
fashionable to cry humbug and delusion, when such
stories are related; but I do not raise that cry, neither
have I a satisfactory explanation of them to offer. The
history and tradition of all nations and people are
full of what seems to be the supernatural; and if that
part is all false, how can we credit the balance of their
history? But most people, after all, have, at least,
some vague impressions, that the departed have something
to do with the world they once inhabited. And
why should they not?</p>

<p>I had an appointment in a Methodist meeting-house
in Washington; and while the congregation was assembling,
the pastor of the church told us we could not
occupy the house; such abominable sentiments should
not be promulgated in the Methodist meeting-house.
I told the congregation, as we were not allowed to
occupy the Methodist house, we would adjourn to the
house of the Lord—a beautiful grove. This being
an unexpected reply, and part of the congregation
being rather pleased, the preacher good-naturedly
said I might say what I pleased in the Methodist
house. Visited many places where I had before
spoken, and reached Chicago, August, 1840, where
I preached three Sabbaths, and then proceeded to
Joliet. Lectured there three times. We have now
a society in that place, and a splendid meeting-house.
Aaron Kinney then resided in Joliet, and preached
there and in the region round about. He subsequently
moved to Farmington, Ill., where he and his
wife died. He was one of the first ministers of our
faith in Illinois, and he labored under many disadvantages.
Liberal Christians were few in number, for<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
the country was thinly populated, and he consequently
was poorly supported. But he persevered in the
good work till death closed his labors. Delivered
one discourse in Peru, but did not find a soul that
sympathized with me. The congregation was large,
but all seemed to be afraid of me. I was informed
of a friend, who resided a few miles below on the
canal, which was then being excavated. Spent one
night with him; and although he seemed to be a good
kind of a man, he lived like a hog. The bill of fare
for the night was, 1st, A hot night; 2d, A dirty bed;
3d, An army of bed-bugs; 4th, Ditto, fleas; 5th,
Ditto, musquitoes. I was glad to leave the dirty
hole. Reached Magnolia in the night; and after
being refused lodging at half of the houses in the village,
a poor drunken man took me in. He treated
me to the best his cabin afforded, which was poor
enough. Found some friends the next day, and
delivered several discourses before I left town. A
preacher could not let me pass without a hit.</p>

<p>“If this man,” said he, “is correct, he is a fool for
traveling about this new country preaching. If I believed
as he does, I would never preach again.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” I replied, “I preach the truth. 1st,
Because it is the truth; 2d, Because I love the truth;
3d, Because truth benefits man. But you seem to
have more regard for party than for truth. Anything
that is not found there you care nothing about,
let it be ever so valuable. You need to be baptized
with the spirit of truth, for you have been baptized
only with the spirit of some party. Jesus, whom you
profess to follow, but really run away from, was an
ardent lover of the truth. He toiled, bled and died
for the truth. He cared nothing about party, but he
was as true to the truth as the needle is to the pole.
He never varied from it one iota in the darkest hour
of his life. When I hear men talk as you have to-day,
I know that they know nothing of the spirit of Christ.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Lectured in Hennipen several times. Dr. Pulsifer
had recently moved there from the East, and took
much interest in getting up the meetings. Have often
been there since, and always found him to be a faithful
friend. I met here several families which had
formerly resided in the East, and were there regular
attendants at the sanctuary, but had not heard a discourse
on the Restitution for several years; and it
made their hearts leap with joy to attend a meeting
of their choice. “Thank God,” said one lady, “for
the blessed privilege of hearing the gospel of our
salvation once more, before I go hence. The Lord
be with you; and may you long live to proclaim
the unsearchable riches of Christ to fallen, sinful
man.”</p>

<p>During this year was the noted presidential campaign,
when General Harrison and Martin Van Buren
were candidates for the White House, and the whole
country was in an uproar. The air was vocal with
“Tippecanoe and Tyler too,” and log cabins, and
cider barrels were moving in all directions at the beat
of the drum. The Democrats disdained such humbuggery,
and lost the day, but after that they were not
a whit behind the Whigs in all sorts of tomfoolery.
Whisky, beer, and such senseless exhibitions, often
command more votes than a just cause. This is a
lamentable and humiliating fact, and the evil will
continue till intelligence and virtue are the ruling
spirits of the land. Meeting a boy eight or ten years
old in the road one day, he cried, “Hurrah for Harrison.”
Wanting some amusement, I said, “You
rascally tory!” “Well, then,” said he, as quick as
lightning, and jumping from the ground, “hurrah
for Dick Johnson and his black ones.” That was a
poser for a Democrat, for Richard M. Johnson, who
was the candidate for the Vice Presidency on the
Democratic ticket, was the father of several darkies.
If that boy is living, he is doubtless now one of our<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
stump orators. I made no reply to the little politician,
but left him alone in his glory.</p>

<p>Lectured in Washington. A preacher delivered a
discourse against the Great Salvation. His chief
argument was based on what he termed “the justice
of God.” The justice of God requires the endless
punishment of the wicked. Some of my remarks
in reply were as follows: What the preacher calls
justice is injustice, is malignity, dark, cruel, infernal
malignity. Because frail, finite man, worm of the
dust, steps aside from the line of duty, and thereby
harms himself, and no one else, the Creator of heaven
and earth must pounce upon him with the wrath and
vengeance of a thousand tigers, and pursue him from
the cradle to the grave, from the grave to the resurrection,
from the resurrection to the infernal regions,
and there commission the devil and all his crew to
keep up the chase through the length and depth of
hell forever and ever. Why, justice would turn pale
at such injustice. But to make out that such cruelty
is pure justice, the preacher said that man violates an
infinite law, and therefore justly merits everlasting
hell-torments. Then the transgression of any law of
God deserves endless woe. Breaking a bone, cutting
the flesh, eating improper food, are violations of God’s
laws, and according to the preacher, richly deserve
ceaseless punishment. A child or a man steals a pin;
that is a violation of the divine law, and both merit
eternal suffering. If disobeying of God’s law merits
infinite punishment, then obeying of it merits infinite
happiness. What then becomes of the Bible
doctrine that “eternal life is the <span class="allsmcap">GIFT</span> of God?” Rom.
vi. 23. If the gentleman is correct, there are no degrees
in crime, guilt or punishment. There cannot
be if every infringement of God’s law is an infinite
offense. He who steals a pin, and he who murders a
man, commit crimes of equal magnitude, and both
are equally guilty, and deserve equal punishment.<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
If one sin merits infinite punishment, ten thousand
sins can merit no more, and God will punish a man
for <em>one sin</em> just as long as he will for a <em>million</em> of sins.
All mankind sin, and therefore all mankind deserve
endless punishment. Who then can be saved, if the
preacher is right? But, said he, Jesus has made an
atonement for the sins of the world, has satisfied
divine justice, and sinners can escape the penalty due
their crimes. How is that? The justice of God satisfied
with the sacrifice of Christ? Did Jesus suffer
the penalty man merits? Did he suffer infinite misery,
the few hours he was on the cross? Did he suffer
all the pain that all mankind deserve for breaking
the law? The preacher must reply, yes. If Jesus
satisfied justice for the “sins of the whole world, original
and actual,” as his creed—the Methodist creed—asserts,
then will not all be saved? Is not God
bound to save all for whom Christ made an atonement?
If the gentleman is correct—if the law is
infinite, if the penalty is infinite, if all deserve endless
hell-torments, and if Jesus has made “an atonement,
a perfect satisfaction for the sins of the whole
world, original and actual,” all are bound to escape,
and reach heaven.</p>

<p>But let the law of God be infinite or finite, man’s
<em>guilt</em> is in proportion to his <em>knowledge</em> of right and
wrong. An idiot may kill a man, but he is not guilty,
for he knows no better. An intelligent person would
be deeply guilty for such a deed. Our guilt, then,
and the punishment we merit, are in exact ratio with
our knowledge of right and wrong. These facts upset
the preacher’s whole theory of infinite sin and
punishment. Justice does not require so much pain
for so much sin. To demand that would be vengeance,
retaliation, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth, just what Jesus condemns. Exercising justice
is giving all parties their due—restoring the equilibrium,
making the crooked straight, the rough smooth,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
causing all flesh to see the salvation of God. It is
not destruction, but restoration; it does not hurl men
from God, but draws them to him; it consigns us not
to hell, but exalts us to heaven. This view of justice
harmonizes with the mercy and goodness of God, and
refutes the line of the poet, that</p>

<p>Lectured in Pekin three times. We have now a
good society and meeting-house in this place. It was
then a small village, now it is a large town. Proceeded
to Tremont, where I spent several days,
and lectured four times. At a subsequent visit to
this place, I had an appointment in Washington,
twelve miles north, on a cold December Sunday
morning. The thermometer was below zero, the
snow deep, and the wind blowing hard from the
north. Started on horseback, and was soon very
cold. I walked, ran, kicked, and thrashed my arms,
but this exercise fatigued me, and I remounted my
horse, and soon became very comfortable, and congratulated
myself that I should get through without
further trouble. A hole being in one of my gloves,
I noticed that one of my fingers looked rather pale,
and I was not long in discovering that I was actually
freezing. It was then two miles to a house, and
when I reached it I hesitated about stopping, I felt so
comfortable. I finally went into the house, and soon
found that my fingers, ears, nose, and face were badly
frozen. Remained there till the next day, but if I
had not stopped, I should probably have frozen to
death, as it was several miles to a house, and across
an open prairie.</p>

<p>Spoke again in Washington. The preacher I
replied to a few days before, was still howling about
the abominations of Universalism, but I said no more
to him. Went to Bloomington, preached three times,<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
and got into a controversy. The preacher was a
strong believer in water baptism—contended that
there was no salvation without it. I told him that
his creed damned nearly all mankind; that a person
might love God and his fellow men, like John, believe
the whole gospel, like Paul, repent of his sins,
like Peter, but unless he was immersed in water, in
the name of Christ, he would be lost forever; if he
was correct, heaven would be almost empty, hell
crowded; Christ redeem but a small portion of mankind,
while the devil would be crowned with nearly
all. The wise and benevolent Author of our being
bases salvation on principles, not on rites—not on
going into water, eating wafers, drinking wine, or
offering incense. Love is the fulfilling of the law.
God is love, his will is love, his power is love, his
spirit is love, his work is love, his law is love, his
gospel is love, and our whole duty is included in love
to God, and love to man. The great need of the
world is, more love, and less show and profession;
more purity of the heart, and less washing of the
hands; more soul religion, and less materialistic religion.</p>

<p>I proceeded to Urbana. Met a man hobbling
along on one leg. He had heard me preach somewhere,
and abruptly said:</p>

<p>“If all are to be saved, what is the use of being
religious?”</p>

<p>“I see you have only one leg. I suppose you
would like to have two sound limbs.”</p>

<p>“That I should. I would freely give my farm for
a leg made of flesh and bone, instead of this concern
made of wood, iron and leather.”</p>

<p>“You remarked a moment since, that you hoped
you were a Christian, and expected to go to heaven
when you left this world. Do you expect to be a
one-legged cripple in heaven?”</p>

<p>“Of course not; all will have perfect bodies there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then, what is the use of your troubling
yourself about your lameness in this world; you will
be all right in heaven; you can hobble out your three
score years and ten, and then all be well with you.”</p>

<p>“But that is no reason why I should not have a
sound body in this world. I want to enjoy all the
blessings I possibly can in this world.”</p>

<p>“My friend, you have answered your question.
You want a whole limb in this world, if you do
expect one in the next. So, we should be religious in
this world if we do expect to partake of God’s blessing
in heaven, for a religious life only is a happy life,
a heavenly life.”</p>

<p>I then proceeded to Perrysville, Ind., in the western
part of the state. This was the end of my journey,
as I did not return to Cincinnati. I had traveled
full eight hundred miles since I left Cincinnati,
and delivered eighty-eight discourses.</p>

</div>

<p>A new era now commenced in my life. I made
Lafayette, Ind., the center of my operations, and
commenced the publication of the <cite>Christian Teacher</cite>,
a monthly publication of twenty-four pages, at one
dollar per year. The first number was issued April,
1841. There were then two other denominational
publications in the West—the <cite>Star in the West</cite>, a
weekly, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the <cite>Philomath Encyclopedia</cite>,
a monthly, in the eastern part of Indiana,
the <cite>Better Covenant</cite> and the <cite>New Covenant</cite> had no
existence, and the <cite>Glad Tidings</cite> and the <cite>Berean</cite> were
discontinued. There was a large field for a publication
of that kind, and I thought it would do a good
work. When the first number was issued, I had two
hundred subscribers, and at the close of the first volume,
eight hundred subscribers. I owned no printing
materials, but had the work done at the office of
the Lafayette <cite>Journal</cite>, published by Major Seaman, a
zealous Methodist, and an honorable man. He has
been in his grave these many years.</p>

<p>In addition to getting out the magazine, I traveled
extensively this year, preaching, and obtaining subscribers
for the journal. Wherever I went I had no
difficulty in introducing it, humble and imperfect as
it certainly was. But I was not able to make many
such long journeys as I had heretofore, for I had to<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
be in Lafayette monthly to read proof and mail the
<cite>Teacher</cite>. I also established a circuit which I traveled
monthly. It included Lafayette, Dayton, Yorktown,
West Point, Perrysville, Jefferson, Independence,
Rainsville, Thorntown, Crawfordsville, Ladoga, Terre
Haute, Lockport, and perhaps two or three other
places. The distance round was about three hundred
miles. In Perrysville a society was organized this
year, and a meeting-house commenced. There was
also one formed in Terre Haute, and preparations
made to erect a house of worship. In Lafayette,
Dayton, and Yorktown, there were also societies
established. As I was the only minister in western
Indiana, where this work was going on, I had my
hands full.</p>

<p>The first time I visited Frankfort, I preached in a
vacant lot by the way-side, as no house could be obtained.
The Presbyterian clergyman, Mr. Taylor,
told his congregation that he had rather the cholera
would come to town than a preacher of my stamp.
A few months after, he attended one of my meetings,
and replied to my discourse. My subject was the
Old Testament doctrine of punishment, and I discoursed
as follows:</p>

<p>1. As the Old Testament contains a record of God’s
first revelations to man, it is reasonable to expect,
that the whole truth concerning the consequences of
wrong doing would be there clearly stated. 2. As
that book speaks of the creation of mankind, and of
the introduction of sin into the world, infinite wisdom
must surely tell the whole truth concerning sin’s direful
results—tell when and where, punishment is
inflicted, and how long it is to continue. 3. The Old
Testament contains the law of God. Jesus said,
“The law came by Moses.” Examine the statutes of
any state, published by its law-makers, and you will
find that the same page that contains the law also
contains the penalty, the whole penalty, for transgressing<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
that law. Is this right, or is it wrong? If
it is right for human legislators to write the law
and the penalty in the same book, and on the same
page, is it not right for the Divine Legislator do
the same? Would not a king be justly deemed a
fool, or a tyrant, who, in publishing his laws to his
subjects, should be silent concerning the penalty, or
make known only a part of it? Has God revealed
the moral law, and is he silent concerning the penalty
for transgressing that law? Is man wiser than
God? Does the wisdom of earth exceed that of
heaven? All admit, that part, at least, of sin’s penalty
is revealed in the Law Book, but many deny that
the whole of it is therein revealed. But why this
partial revelation? Why was the world for four
thousand years in the dark concerning the penalty of
sin? For the forty centuries before Christ, was a
vast stream of human beings plunging headlong into
a bottomless pit, and not a warning given of their
impending fate, till they heard the stunning roar of
the infernal cataract? This is affirmed by many
learned divines. They admit that the Old Testament
does not teach eternal punishment, but at the same
time they contend, that from Adam to Christ, the
penalty for transgression was eternal punishment, and
consequently all nations and people were during that
time exposed to that terrible storm of wrath. Away
with such blasphemous imputations. Wisdom, goodness,
justice, assure us, that the great Lawgiver kept
nought back of sin’s penalty, but revealed the truth,
the whole truth, and at the same time he gave the
law. And here it is in such plain language that a
child can understand it. I will read from Deuteronomy
xxviii.:</p>

<p>“It shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken
unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do
<em>all his</em> commandments and statutes which I command
thee this day, that <em>all these curses</em> shall come upon<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
thee, and overtake thee: Cursed shalt thou be in the
city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. Cursed
shall be thy basket and thy store. Cursed shall be
the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the
increase of thy cattle, and the flocks of thy sheep.
Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed
shalt thou be when thou goest out. The Lord shall
send upon thee cursing, vexation and rebuke in all
that thou settest thine hand unto to do.... He shall
smite thee with consumption, and with a fever, with
blasting and mildew; and the Lord shall make the
pestilence cleave unto thee, <em>until he shall have consumed
thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess
it</em>.”</p>

<p>“Moreover, all these curses shall come upon thee,
and shall pursue thee till thou be destroyed; because
thou hearkendst not unto the voice of the Lord thy
God, to keep his commandments and his statutes,
which he commanded thee. Because thou servedst
not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness
of heart, for the abundance of all things, therefore
shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord
shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and
in nakedness, and in want of all things. And thine
enemy shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy
high and fenced walls shall come down, wherein thou
trustedest. Thou shalt beget sons and daughters,
but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into
captivity. And thou shalt become an astonishment,
a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither
the Lord shall lead thee.”</p>

<p>This language cannot be misunderstood. No lawgiver
ever stated the penalty for transgression in
plainer terms. The Jews, if they sinned, were to
suffer in body and mind, in head and heart, at home
and abroad, till they were consumed from the land.
But <em>beyond the land</em> there is not an intimation that
endless woe would be their doom. That the apostle<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
Paul understood the consequences of sin to be temporal,
is evident from these words, “For if the words
spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression
and disobedience <em>received</em> a just recompense of
reward; how shall we escape if we neglect so great
a salvation?” Heb. ii. 23. The apostle here speaks
of <em>past wickedness</em>, and says it <span class="allsmcap">HAD RECEIVED A JUST
RECOMPENSE OF REWARD</span>, and the countless millions of
the dead consequently were not <span class="allsmcap">TO BE</span> receiving it
through the ceaseless ages of eternity. They had
received a just recompense of reward, and were at
rest. All the moral elements of the law are as much
in force to-day as they were when they were revealed
to Moses, and the penalty is the same now <a id="Ref_107" href="#BRef_107">as</a> it was
then. Good men are blessed <em>now</em>, and wicked men
are cursed <em>now</em>. Goodness blesses the one, and vice
curses the other. It is as true now of all who have
lived, that they <em>have</em> received a just recompense of
reward, as it was in St. Paul’s day and generation.
The Old Testament, from beginning to end, reiterates
the same lesson concerning the present blasting effects
of vice in all its varied forms.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor, in reply, admitted that the Old Testament
teaches, that the wicked in <em>part</em> are punished in
this world, that they have a foretaste of hell this side
of the grave, a morsel of what is in reservation for
them beyond the tomb. He also admitted, that
Moses did not teach endless punishment, but the
prophets did teach it, though not in as clear language
as did Christ and the apostles. A future life was only
partially revealed during the Law Dispensation; it
was reserved for the Son of God to fully bring life
and immortality to light. So with regard to hell; it
was obscurely revealed by the prophets, but clearly
revealed by the Savior of man.</p>

<p>I rejoined thus: “Hell obscurely revealed by the
prophets!” And yet, Mr. Taylor tells us, that from
Adam to Christ, multitudes were daily dropping into<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
the infernal regions. Hell should have been revealed
more distinctly than death or the grave, for it might
have been shunned if timely warning had been given.
Only think of a God of love imparting existence to
human beings, knowing, that by day and by night,
from the cradle to the grave, they were in imminent
danger of falling into a fathomless gulf, there ever to
writhe in immortal agonies, and having his omniscient
eye on them during the whole of their earthly
pilgrimage—yet only <span class="allsmcap">OBSCURELY HINT</span> to them of
their danger. What kind of a God, sir, do you worship?
But then heaven, he says, was only obscurely
revealed under the law. I am amazed that a good,
intelligent and learned man should deceive himself by
such sophistry. It may be consistent for a parent in
his last will and testament to withhold knowledge of
a great <em>good</em> for a given period from his children,
but he must be a monster to withhold for a moment
knowledge of an <em>impending evil</em>, especially if he
knows they may escape it by timely warning.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the discussion closed,
and I spent the rest of the night at his house, by his
request. The next morning, he prayed that I might
be converted to the knowledge of the truth, and then
proposed a public discussion in Frankfort. The propositions
were agreed on, but the time was not specified,
and I never could, subsequently, induce him to
name the date for the debate to commence. He put
me off from time to time, and finally the matter was
dropped.</p>

<p>About this time, I had a discussion in Independence,
Ind., with Mr. Campbell, a Methodist minister,
and that was my first regular oral debate. I had
often had <em>skirmishes</em>, but this was my first regular
pitched battle, and I went into it with much fear and
trembling. I had confidence in the <em>truth</em>, but feared I
should fail in defending it. And to this day, I never
commence a discussion without similar fears; but<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
when I get excited, and have the measure of my
man, I feel tolerably bold. The subject of discussion
was endless punishment. Mr. Campbell was a
Scotchman, and pretty wiry. The discussion elicited
much interest, and large assemblies listened to it.
The following is the substance of one of my speeches:</p>

<p>The consequences of sin were revealed to our first
parents in the following words: “And the Lord God
took the man, and put him in the garden of Eden
to dress it, and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded
the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden
thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the
day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” Gen.
ii. 15-17. Here is the first commandment, and the
first penalty, and we may expect that a wise, just and
merciful God would inform our race in its very infancy,
of the whole results of wickedness. If eternal
woe is the penalty, it should have been then and
there, at the very gate of Eden, proclaimed in distinct
and unmistakable language. This the welfare
of man, in time and in eternity, required. If man’s
everlasting weal or woe depends on his choosing evil
or good in this world, that tremendous fact should
have been announced in Eden in such thundering
tones, that its echo would reverberate down all the
succeeding ages, through every valley, across every
plain, over every mountain, so that all the living, yea,
the dead, should hear it. If belief in endless woe is
the conservative of virtue, and the denial of it infidelity,
that dogma should have been proclaimed so loud
and so distinct, it should have been so stamped on
every heart, that a blazing hell and terrible devils,
would have been the first thoughts of childhood, and
not to be forgotten till the eyes were closed in death,
and the heart ceased to beat.</p>

<p>But what saith the passage: “In the day thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die.” Is that all the<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
penalty? Every word of it. Not a syllable about
endless death, endless misery, endless hell. Mr.
Campbell, who authorized <em>you</em> to put <em>endless</em> before
death? You <em>add</em> to the word of God, and you know
what is said of those who do that wicked thing. The
punishment was that they should <em>die</em>. The Bible
speaks of national death, temporal death, death to
sin, and death in sin. But here it cannot mean
national death, or death to sin; neither can it mean
temporal death, for Adam lived hundreds of years
after he sinned. Reference, without doubt, is to
death in sin, a moral death—death to purity, innocence,
virtue, happiness, which is symbolized by his
being driven out of the garden. We were all in that
garden once. Jesus took little children in his arms
and blessed them, saying: “Of such is the kingdom
of heaven.” But Adam was cast out, and most of us
share the same fate. Adam in Eden represents our
childhood, and out of it our sinful state. This death
in sin, which Adam suffered, and multitudes of others
suffer, is often spoken of in the Bible. Said Jesus,
“Let the dead bury the dead;” that is, let the dead
in sin bury the temporally dead. “You hath he
quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin....
Even when we were dead in sin hath he quickened us
together with Christ.” Eph. ii. 1, 5. This moral
death means a great deal. It includes sin itself, and
all its moral consequences—degradation, debasement,
condemnation, darkness, hell, and ultimates often in
<a id ="Ref_110" href="#BRef_110">temporal</a> ruin. This soul-debasement results in jails,
penitentiaries and gallows; in slavery, war and tyranny;
in premature graves, desolated cities, and ruined
nations.</p>

<p>But where and when was the penalty to be inflicted?
Mark the words: “<span class="smcap">In the day</span> thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die.” Sin and its penalty
are bound—chained together. It does not read that
they would not be punished till the judgment day,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
thousands of years hence, at the end of time. That
is Mr. Campbell’s theory; but the truth is, that sin
and punishment go hand in hand, at all times, and in
all places, and if he can prove eternal sinning, I will
prove eternal suffering. Notice also, that the punishment
was <em>sure</em>. In the day thou sinneth thou shalt
<em>surely</em> die. If you jump into the sea, and cannot
swim, you must suffer the consequences; if you swallow
a dose of poison, and it penetrates your vitals,
you must abide the result; so he who transgresses the
moral law of God, must suffer its blasting, damning
effects. “Ye <em>shall surely</em> die.” Repentance may
mitigate the result in <em>part</em>, but the curse cleaves to
the sinner till there is an entire transformation of
character. But the penalty is not <em>endless</em>, else who
can be saved from sin? It was not termed endless
when it was first revealed, neither is it called endless
in any part of the Bible. The gentleman will have
to hunt up evidence outside of the book to make out
endless woe for the sins of this life.</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell replied: “That the death threatened
Adam, was death temporal, death spiritual, and death
eternal; and although it was not termed <em>eternal</em> in
the passage, it was clearly implied there, and distinctly
taught all through the Bible.”</p>

<p>I answered: Here are two assumptions. 1. That
the death was threefold. There is no such intimation
in the passage or elsewhere in the Bible. 2.
That the death is <em>eternal</em>. It is not so termed from
Genesis to Revelation.</p>

<p>But I have not room for more of that discussion.
Mr. Campbell seemed satisfied with his defense of
ceaseless woe, and we parted in friendship.</p>

<p>I got along better with this discussion than I expected,
and was more willing afterwards to engage in
such debates. Many well meaning persons oppose
the public discussion of religious subjects; they think
it does no good, but much harm; but they do not<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
properly discriminate between the abuse and proper
use of discussion. That it may be, and often is
abused, there can be no doubt; but what good thing
can be named, that is not liable to be abused? And
it seems that the best of God’s blessings, when improperly
directed by erring men, are the greatest
curses. Fire, water, air, steam, electricity, when legitimately
employed, are vast benefactors to man, but
when illegitimately employed, they deal death and
destruction all around. Man, when he answers the
end of his being, is almost an angel, but when his
noble faculties are prostituted to base purposes, he
becomes a fiend. The gospel is the power of God
unto salvation, to all who cherish it deep in their
hearts, but in the hands of wicked men it may deluge
the world with blood and tears. So religious discussion,
where truth and error grapple, if conducted with
proper motives, and in the right spirit, is a lever of
reform; it opens the eyes of the blind, unstops the
ears of the deaf, and often takes away the heart of
stone and gives a heart of flesh; hence reformers in
all ages have courted discussion. Socrates was a
famous debater, Jesus traveled from town to town,
and Paul from nation to nation, discussing with the
people, and turning the world upside down. Luther,
by his controversial tongue and pen, sent the Pope
of Rome, and the Catholic Church, headlong to the
gates of their long home. After that tongue was
silent, and that pen dry, they rallied, and prolonged
their existence. Let every subject of human thought
be discussed freely, but kindly, honestly, wisely. It
will do no harm, but much good. But I have
observed that it is the advocates of established theories,
exclusively, that oppose discussion. They do
not want their slumbers disturbed by noisy debate;
they might wake up and see and hear something
new. Cry aloud, reformers, and spare not; do not
be afraid of making a noise in the sleepy hollows of<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
the earth. Say to all, Awake, think, investigate,
judge. The divine injunction is, “Prove all things,
and hold fast that which is good;” “Come, let us
reason together.”</p>

<p>There was so much opposition to liberal principles,
that the people wanted doctrinal and explanatory discourses,
but I always dwelt more or less on the moral
and the spiritual. Mere doctrinal and explanatory
discourses, without showing the moral and spiritual
bearing of truth, do but little good. In almost every
place I visited, the preachers were fighting our faith,
and slandering its advocates, and our friends wanted
me to repel these assaults, which gave my sermons a
controversial character, and some times a peppery
flavor. But I always kept the great truth prominent
in my ministrations, that heaven and everlasting life
can be enjoyed in this world; that we should lay hold
on them; lay up treasures where moth and rust cannot
corrupt, and where thieves cannot break through and
steal. And I had the satisfaction of knowing that
not only many minds were enlightened by truth
divine, but many hearts were improved by its saving
influence.</p>

<p>And here I am reminded of another outrageous
attack of a Methodist preacher, Mr. Cooper, on Universalists,
in Independence. “They are,” said he,
“the vilest of the vile. The jails, penitentiaries, rum
holes, gambling dens, are full of them. They defy
heaven and blaspheme God. This is their general
character.”</p>

<p>I replied: This is all slander, and this lying priest
knows it. He knows that he bears false witness
against his acquaintance, his neighbors, the citizens
of this place. He sins willfully, maliciously, and he
had better not let the sun go down on his wrath. All
who live in this community know that he poured out
this day vials of falsehood; they know that some of
the best citizens of this county are of the faith he condemns;<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
they know also, that the wicked places he
speaks of, in this community, are not filled with persons
of our faith. He cannot name a grog-shop keeper
in this county, who professes to be a Universalist;
but I can name several advocates of eternal punishment,
and some of them were once members of his
church, who are in that kind of business; and for
every gambler here, who ever thought of calling himself
a Universalist, I can name ten who will swear
over their cards and bottles, that there is an endless
hell; and for every Universalist he may produce, who
uses profane language, I can produce ten advocates
of eternal punishment, who blaspheme God and heaven
daily by their profanity. I want no better evidence
of the immoral tendency of partialism than the
speaker has given to-day; and I am sure that publicans
and sinners will enter the kingdom of heaven
before characters of his stamp. I do not pretend, that
all who call themselves by our name are Christians in
life and practice. Are all the believers in immortal
woe Christians? History says, <em>no</em>; every man and
woman living on earth will say, <em>no</em>. The persecutors
and murderers of Christ and his apostles; those who
pursued the Christians in the first and second centuries
of the Christian Era, with fire and sword, were
zealous advocates of eternal burnings. The Catholics
who tortured, hung, beheaded, quartered, millions of
Christians and Pagans, were all staunch believers in
hell. Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Puritans, and Independents,
who hung Quakers, burned witches, and
persecuted and murdered each other, and the Catholics,
were unwavering in the fiery faith. Ninety-nine
one hundredths of all the thieves, murderers, pirates,
gamblers, rum-sellers, rum-drinkers, are believers in
eternal woe. These are facts, which history and
observation substantiate. If Universalism had been
believed, and preached as long and as generally as
eternal punishment has been, and if mankind were<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
no better than they are now, I, for one, would be
ashamed to boast of its good moral influence. I do
not say that all the advocates of eternal punishment
are reprobates. There are noble and pure Christians
in all denominations, many of them, more of that
character than otherwise, but faith in hell has yet the
first Christian to make. Believers in that cruel dogma,
many of them, are Christians in spite of their
faith in it. The tendency of faith in hell is downward,
while the innate goodness of their hearts, and the many
truths they cherish, direct them heavenward. I do
not contend that all believers in the Restitution are
practical Christians. Would to God they were, but I
know they are not. But give this divine philosophy
time to do its work in the world; give it time to germinate,
root, bud, blossom, and yield its fruit, before
you condemn it. Belief in vengeance has had ample
time to develop itself in human character, and it has
produced its like the world over. Give the doctrine
of <span class="smcap">Love</span> and <span class="smcap">Justice</span> an opportunity to yield its legitimate
fruit before you cast it out as evil. Besides, the
immoral men, who hang at our skirts, were cradled,
educated, and grew to manhood, not under the influence
of our benevolent faith, but under the guns of
Orthodoxy, and it, if any creed, is responsible for their
character. But because Universalism does not do in
a day what Orthodoxy has failed to do in years, it is
said to be immoral in its tendency!</p>

<p>About this time, I had a discussion in a grove near
Burlington, Ind., with Harper Hanna, a Methodist
minister, which continued four days. I had not been
in the neighborhood before the discussion commenced,
neither had a discourse on the Restitution been delivered
there, consequently, the people were totally in
the dark concerning our faith, and strongly prejudiced
against it. On the other hand, Mr. Hanna was
in the midst of his friends, and had all their prejudices
in his favor. It was a daring thing to debate<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
under such circumstances, but I went through with it,
and had the satisfaction of knowing that I did not
labor in vain. I had afterwards monthly appointments
in the neighborhood. It was amusing to see
the people scan me, and watch every motion. If I
had been an elephant, I would not have been a subject
of more curiosity. The themes of discussion
were endless punishment and universal salvation. In
my first speech I said:</p>

<p>Put a man in prison and keep him there one year—that
would be a severe penalty. Keep him there ten
years—that would be an awful infliction. Keep him
there his whole natural lifetime—that would be dreadful
beyond description. But what is one year, what
are ten years, yea, seventy years of imprisonment,
compared to <em>endless</em> suffering in hell? Let all the
suffering of head and heart, soul and body, that all
mankind have endured in all ages, and all climes, be
combined in <em>one pang</em>, and that one pang would
not amount to as much woe as one soul will suffer if
doomed to endure ceaseless misery. The fires in
which the damned will live and move, will be in full
blast when this earth shall be gray with age, when
the flames of the mid-day sun shall flicker like the
dying taper in its socket, yea, they will continue to
burn deep into the souls of countless millions while
heaven shall stand and God exist. That is endless
misery; and that is what Mr. Hanna affirms, and is
trying to prove, will be the doom of a large part of
mankind. It is a dreadful work to charge the God
of heaven with doing; to stand up in this beautiful
world, amid the manifestations of God’s love, and
charge the Author of all these blessings, with inflicting
an eternity of woe on worms of the dust. I believe
in punishment—in righteous, just punishment—but
I do not, dare not, believe, that the Father of all
mercies, and whose name and nature is love, will,
for the sins of a day, doom innumerable multitudes<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
of his offspring to blow the fires of hell forever.</p>

<p>At the close of the debate, he adopted a little expedient,
that he was sure would be a perfect success—to
him. He wanted the assembly to decide by <em>vote</em>,
which party had triumphed in the discussion. Being
in the midst of his friends, and relying on the prejudices
of the people, he doubted not that an overwhelming
majority would crown him victor. I was
of the same opinion for the same reasons, and hence
opposed his crafty maneuver. But being determined
that the assembly should vote that he was the hero
of the day, he requested all to rise who thought Harper
Hanna has sustained his propositions. About
one fourth of the congregation heeded his call. He
looked the picture of amazement at so few voting
that he was the conqueror. “Get up,” said he,
“you misunderstand me;” and he again called on all
to rise, who thought Harper Hanna had sustained
his cause. Not another one was added to his voting
friends. Finding he could drum up no more, he
requested all to stand up, who thought Mr. Manford
had proved that Universalism was the gospel. Two
thirds of the assembly bounded to their feet. Poor
Hanna turned pale as death, and uttering not a word,
sunk into his chair.</p>

<p>On my way back to Lafayette, I rode in company
with a man who had heard of the debate, but did not
know me.</p>

<p>“There has been a discussion,” said he, “in Burlington,
on Universalism.”</p>

<p>“Did you attend?”</p>

<p>“No; it is wrong to hold such discussions. Universalism
is a <em>lie</em>, and every Christian should call it a
<em>lie</em>, and have nothing to do with it, or its advocates.
It is the devil who induces Christians to debate with
Universalists. It is one of his schemes to lead souls
down to hell. Several of my neighbors came home
from the discussion, advocating that wicked doctrine.<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
They were Christians, but I fear they are ruined.
Two of them say they shall withdraw from our
church. Mr. Hanna did wrong in debating with that
Manford. He has introduced a viper into this county,
and I fear some are already stung to death.
Well, I did my duty. I stayed at home, and did all
I could to keep my neighbors at home. But they
were possessed with a desire to hear the debate, and
the result is even worse than I expected. Our minister
is going to try to undo the evil in our neighborhood.
Next Sunday he will preach a sermon against
Universalism.”</p>

<p>“Did your minister attend the discussion?”</p>

<p>“He did; and he says he went there to learn what
could be said in favor of such a doctrine. He is sure
he can convince all that it is as false as sin. One of
my neighbors says he shall send for Manford to reply
to him. But he cannot preach in our church. He
may be sure of that.”</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after this, I had an oral debate in Lafayette,
with Mr. Jeffries, Protestant Methodist, of that place,
which continued four days. One of my principal
proof-texts was 1 Corinthians, 15th chapter. I spoke
as follows: This is one of the longest chapters in the
New Testament, and in it the apostle discourses on
very important subjects—on life and death, mortality
and immortality, the earthy nature and heavenly nature.
There are two general statements in this chapter.
1st. We must all die in Adam. 2d. We shall
all be made alive in Christ. I will notice these statements
in the order I have named them.</p>

<p>1st. We must all die. “As in Adam all die.”
This does not say we must die because a man by the
name of Adam did so and so, six thousand years ago.
Adam is a Hebrew word, and signifies <em>man</em>. Job
says, “<em>Man</em> that is born of a woman is of few days
and full of trouble.” In the original it reads, <em>Adam</em>,
instead of man. That Adam simply means man, or
mankind, is evident from the account of the creation
of our race, in Genesis. “Let us make <em>man</em> (Adam)
in our image, after our likeness, and let <em>them</em> have
dominion.” Here the plural verb shows that the
word Adam is employed collectively, meaning <em>mankind</em>.
“And God created <em>the man</em> (the Adam) in his<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
own image: in the image of God created he him;
male and female created he <em>them</em>.” Here both the
application of “male and female” to <em>the Adam</em>, and
the plural pronoun at the end of the verse shows that
the man is used generically, and that it is equivalent
to the first of <em>mankind</em>. The word Adam, then, was
not a proper name, but an appellative noun for the
human species; its application to the first man, as his
proper name, was subsequent and secondary. Hence
when the apostle says, “As in Adam all die,” he
means, As in the Adamic nature, the earthy, corruptible,
mortal nature, all die. Adam means mortal man,
and all mankind die in that nature.</p>

<p>2d. The other statement is contained in the same
verse—“Even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”
“Made alive in Christ,” is contrasted with “die in
Adam;” and as Adam means the earthy nature, so
Christ means the heavenly nature. Here is universal
death in the earthy nature, and universal life in
heavenly nature. All die on earth and all shall live
in heaven. But in the Adamic nature is the <em>germ</em> of
the Christ-like nature, as in the corn is the germ of
the future stock. In this chapter the apostle gives
this beautiful analogy thus: “But some man will say,
How are the dead raised up? and with what body do
they come?” In answering these questions the apostle
shows, that the germ of the heavenly man is in
the earthy man. “Thou fool! that which thou sowest
is not quickened except it die.” The seed corresponds
to the mortal body; the <em>germ</em> corresponds
to the spirit in man; and as the sowing of the seed
develops the germ into a beautiful and vigorous plant,
to bask in the sunshine, inhale the air, and drink the
dews of heaven, so the death of the mortal body
quickens the indwelling spirit, and it enters with
renewed vigor on its immortal and heavenly life.
The seed then is an emblem of man; its resurrection
an emblem of man’s resurrection. Who can deny a<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
resurrection when the world is so full of emblems
pointing man to that great fact in his own destiny.
“So,” says the apostle, referring to this beautiful
illustration, “is the resurrection of <em>the dead</em>”—all
the dead, all who die in the earthy nature. In the
words, “It is sown,” the writer seems to refer to the
seed sown in the ground, still making it an emblem
of man. Mankind sown in corruption, dishonor, are
raised incorruptible, glorious. The second body is
more glorious than the first, as the rose is more glorious
than the seed. These citations show what the
apostle means by the words, “made alive in Christ;”
and remember, that all who die in the Adamic nature
are thus to be made alive.</p>

<p>“Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God, even the Father,” etc. (See
verses 24-28). Here we learn what is to be destroyed.
1. “All rule.” 2. “All authority.” 3. “All power.”
4. “Death.” And mark you, that death is the <span class="allsmcap">LAST</span>
enemy. My friend asserts, that death is <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> the last
enemy, but that beyond death, and <span class="allsmcap">IN HELL</span>, there are
legions of enemies to be the everlasting tormentors
of countless millions of mankind. If the gentleman
is correct, death is not the <em>last</em> enemy, but rather the
<em>first real enemy</em>, and opens the door to the fires,
furies, and demons of perdition, which will burn and
lash their victims world without end. Let it also be
noted, that the last enemy is to be <span class="allsmcap">DESTROYED</span>. The
apostle continues his statements concerning the subjugation
of all things to God thus: “And when all
things shall be subdued to God, then shall the Son
himself be subject to him, that put all things under
him that God may be all in all.” This is the <span class="allsmcap">END</span> to
which mankind are tending, and this consummation
will surely be realized. All sin, error, suffering and
death, shall be abolished; all mankind subdued to
God, and God <span class="allsmcap">ALL IN ALL</span>. The sum of this chapter
then is this—all mankind are mortal, corruptible,<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
and must die; death is destruction to the <em>body</em>, but
life to the <em>soul</em>; glory, honor and immortality, are
the rich inheritance of mankind.</p>

<p>“The apostle,” replied Mr. J., “teaches the resurrection
of the <em>body</em>, not of the <em>spirit</em>, and I admit that
he teaches the resurrection of all the dead, and when
that shall be effected the absent spirits will claim
their long lost bodies.”</p>

<p>I rejoined: The gentleman tells us, that the writer
of this chapter teaches the resurrection of the bodies
of all the dead. If he is correct, God will raise the
bodies of saints and sinners, Jews and Gentiles, incorruptible,
glorious, heavenly, and when that shall be
done, he will unlock hell, and take the deformed, corrupt,
wretched spirits, that have been imprisoned in
that foul dungeon for thousands of years, and perhaps
millions of ages, and put them into those beautiful,
glorious, heavenly bodies. That would be a union
of perfect purity with total depravity, a marriage of
heaven and hell, and two bodies so totally unlike
would fly asunder like fire and water. The truth is,
the apostle speaks not of the resurrection of this mortal
body, these bones and muscles, this flesh and
blood, but of <em>the man</em>—the inner, spiritual, real man.
This body is necessary, while we are denizens of
earth. By means of it the spirit is connected with
the outer world, but when we shall be dwellers of the
spirit land, we shall have no further use of these mortal
tabernacles.</p>

<p>In his first speech on the proposition relating to
endless punishment, Mr. Jeffries boasted that he
should make short work of me and of my faith. “I
have,” said he, “one text to quote, and one question
to ask. The text is Matthew xii. 31, 32. ‘Wherefore
I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever
speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven
him, neither in this world, neither in the world
to come.’ And this is the question: If the sin against
the Holy Ghost was not to be forgiven in this world,
or in the world to come, <em>where will it be forgiven</em>?
I once had a debate with Jonathan Kidwell, and I
cited this verse, and asked this question, and it
brought the discussion to a <em>close</em>, for Mr. Kidwell
could neither answer the question nor explain the
passage so as to save Universalism from total destruction.
The debate was to continue four days, but it
lasted twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>I responded as follows: The gentleman pretends
that he once “used up” one man by one question,
and one text, and he expects to demolish me in the
same easy and summary manner; but the sequel may
show that he is over sanguine. I will show that the
passage on which he so confidently relies to sustain
his monstrous proposition, affords it no aid whatever.</p>

<p>1. If the words, “this world and the world to
come,” mean this life and the life to come, as my
friend supposes, then <em>all sin</em>, save the <em>one sin</em> against
the Holy Ghost, may be forgiven in the <em>future state</em>.
The passage reads, “<em>All</em> manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men.” The parallel passage
(Mark iii. 28) reads thus: “<em>All sins</em> shall be forgiven
unto the sons of men, and [all] blasphemies
wherewithsoever they shall blaspheme.” It is as
clear as daylight, from these passages, that <em>all sins</em>,
except the <em>one</em> specified, can be forgiven “in this
world or the world to come.” If the gentleman is
right in his application of the passage, <em>all sins but
one</em>, may be forgiven in the future state of being, and
his creed is consequently <em>false</em>, for it asserts that God
will not permit a sin to be forgiven on the other side
of the river, but every sin the soul harbors when it
shuffles off its mortal coil, becomes fossilized, immortal<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
as God himself. He must either abandon his text
or his unforgiving creed.</p>

<p>2. The gentleman relies on the word, <em>shall</em>—the
sin against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven.
That word occurs twice in the passage, and I wish to
call his special attention to where it occurs the second
time. <span class="smcap">All sins shall be forgiven.</span> If <em>shall</em> is to be
understood in the absolute sense in one place, it must
in the other, and then the passage means, that all sin,
except that <em>one</em> against the Holy Ghost, <span class="allsmcap">SHALL</span> be forgiven
somewhere, either in this world or the world to
come. The passage, then, instead of blasting our
blissful hope and cherished faith, that all sin and
wrong will ultimately end, strikes a death-blow at the
gentleman’s creed concerning the immortality of
wickedness of every name and grade.</p>

<p>3. It is by no means certain, that “this world and
world to come,” means this life and life to come.
The most learned men of all schools tell us, that the
passage should be translated, this <em>age</em> and <em>age</em> to
come, meaning the Jewish age or dispensation, and
Christian age or dispensation. Dr. Adam Clarke
takes this view of the words: “Though I follow the
common translation, yet I am <span class="allsmcap">FULLY SATISFIED</span> the
meaning of the words is, neither in this <em>dispensation</em>,
viz., the Jewish, nor in that which is to come, viz.,
the <em>Christian</em>. <em>Olam ha-bo, the world to come</em>, is a
constant phrase for the times of the Messiah, in the
Jewish writings.” Bishop Pearce says, “Rather, neither
in this <em>age</em>, nor in the <em>age</em> to come;” meaning
the Jewish and Christian dispensations.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, in his next speech, “if the sin
against the Holy Ghost was not to be forgiven in the
Jewish age or Christian age, when was it to be forgiven?
The Jewish age commenced in the days of
Moses and ended when Christ was crucified; the
Christian age commenced then, and will not end till
death shall be swallowed up in victory. <em>When</em> and<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
<em>where</em> can that sin be forgiven? Will Mr. Manford
answer that question?”</p>

<p>Reply. The Jewish and Christian ages belong to
<em>this stage</em> of existence, and when the Jordan of death
shall be passed, we shall not be living in the Jewish
age or Christian age, but in the <em>spirit age</em>, <em>spirit
world</em>, and the passage does not intimate that sin or
any other sin cannot be forgiven there. The truth is,
that the wisdom, the light, the glory of the spirit
world will soon transform every soul into its image.
When the sun crosses the equator, on the twentieth
of March, how dead the vegetable kingdom lies, horror
wide extends his desolate domain. But the sun
soon begins to impart his renovating grace to root and
seed, and the result is, a <em>general resurrection</em> on hill,
dale and plain. Nothing can resist his influence; all
vegetation comes forth to newness of life. So the
wisdom and love of heaven, corresponding to the
light and heat of the sun of this world, illuminates
and warms every soul, and quickens each and all into
newness of life. Say not, then, that sin cannot be put
away from the soul on the other side of the river.
We should not cheat ourselves by delaying to live a
Christian life till middle age, or till we enter the spirit
land, but in the words of Dr. Watts,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“While the lamp holds out to burn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The vilest sinner may return.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>lamp of life</em> will burn forever, and the time or
place will never be known, where and when, the sinner
cannot return to truth, to virtue—to God. Every
tree and shrub is invigorated and developed by
the sun’s life-giving beams, so the great spiritual Sun
does not shine in vain; every soul will be blessed by
his divine emanations. In the language of the Bible,
“All nations whom thou hast made shall go and worship
before thee O Lord, and glorify thy name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“You forget,” said my opponent, in his last speech
on the above passage, “that those who committed the
sin against the Holy Ghost, were in danger of <em>eternal
damnation</em>.”</p>

<p>No, sir, I have not forgotten that; neither have I
forgotten, that if the sin named is absolutely <em>never</em> to
be forgiven, the sinner who commits it is not in <em>danger</em>
of suffering damnation, but is <em>sure</em> of suffering it,
just as sure as he has sinned. There is no remedy,
his doom is sealed. These words, then, clearly imply,
that the punishment named may be arrested.
This is an important consideration. Again, the word,
<em>eternal</em> is from the same Greek term that <em>world</em> is,
and Dr. Clarke, as we have seen, says it means <em>age</em>,
and learned men of all denominations admit it signifies
age, time, life-time. I have now noticed every
point the gentleman made on this noted passage, and
it is evident that it affords the dogma of immortal
wretchedness no support.</p>

<p>I delivered several lectures at the Tippecanoe battle
ground, and became acquainted with many persons,
who have ever since been steadfast friends. This place
is six miles north of Lafayette. There is a marsh on
one side, and a small stream, with a narrow bottom,
covered with thick woods, on the other. The distance
from the swamp to the stream is about three
hundred yards, and on this narrow belt of ground
General Harrison’s army was encamped, and the battle
fought. No military man, I suppose, would deem
that a safe camping-ground in an enemy’s country.
But Harrison did not expect the Indians would fight,
but rather treat for peace; but he should have been
more cautious. He repelled the attack, with heavy
loss to his army, but if he had been defeated, his
force would have suffered sorely, for the Wabash
river was in his rear, only one mile distant, and that
without bridge or boats.</p>

<p>I also preached in Monticello, and was replied to<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
by a Methodist minister. My text was, “Go ye into
all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and
he that believeth not shall be damned.” The gospel,
I said, comprises the theological and moral doctrines
that Jesus taught. He told men, that God
was the Father of the spirits of all flesh; that the
high and the low, the rich and the poor, the wise
and the ignorant, the black and the white, the slave
and his master, were alike the children of God,
and belong to and compose one family; that the
physical, intellectual, and moral bounties of God’s
store-house were accessible to all, and that the Master
of the feast invites all to partake freely and live. He
had doomed none, and never would doom any, to
eternal starvation. “Ho, every one that thirsteth,
come ye to the waters, and ye that have no money,
come, buy wine and milk without money and without
price.” If we are wise and partake of this feast of
fat things, we live, are blessed with salvation, and the
kingdom of God, which is righteousness, joy and
peace in the holy spirit, reigns in the soul. But if we
shun the rich provisions of the Father’s board, walk
on the other side, choose darkness, error and sin,
rather than light, truth and virtue, woe be to us.
Every heavenly principle, every law of God condemns
us, till we set our faces heavenward, and turn
our steps upward.</p>

<p>“There was not,” said the preacher, “one particle
of gospel in that sermon. Mankind were lost and
ruined by the fall of Adam; the seal of eternal damnation
was <em>burnt</em> deep into the hearts of all, by
Adam’s apostasy, and God became incarnate to make
it <em>possible</em> for man to be saved. Those who believe in
the incarnate God are saved from hell, from the wrath
of God, and the curse of the fall; but those who reject
the crucified Jesus, are lost beyond redemption, and
the seal of damnation will burn deeper and deeper<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
into their immortal souls; they will be abandoned
by God, Christ, angels, and all the saints will say,
<em>amen</em>.”</p>

<p>He was one of the most orthodox preachers I ever
heard. When in the pulpit, he was always harping
on the mysterious jargons of Orthodoxy, with his face
elongated, and a countenance bordering on despair;
but out of the pulpit he was a boy, and a foolish boy
too. When preaching in Logansport, shortly after
General Tipton died, a noted citizen of that place, he
cried, “There, General Tipton, that old sinner, is
dead and gone to hell.” A son of Mr. Tipton, soon
after, met the preacher on a long bridge at Logansport,
and with a whip gave him a pretty hard thrashing.
He begged for mercy, and promised not to talk
in that style any more.</p>

<p>During the first two years I resided in Lafayette, I
seldom met a minister of my faith. There were only
two others in Indiana at that time, and they were in
remote parts of the state, and being aged men did not
preach much, but after that time I had more ministerial
associates. D. Vines, of Frankfort, spoke some
in public, and received Letter of Fellowship. His
intentions were good, but his qualifications meager.
He subsequently became a Swedenborgian, or a Spiritualist,
and I have lost sight of him. Samuel Oyler,
of Jefferson, also entered the ministry. He preached
three or four years in the south part of the state, and
then came out a lawyer, and, I understand, he succeeds
well in that profession. I. M. Westfall, of
Thornton, left the Methodist church, of which he was
a lay-member, and commenced preaching without any
preparation, save strong faith and ardent zeal. He
possessed a good mind, and soon became a popular
speaker. He remained in Indiana about one year,
and then moved to Iowa City, Iowa. He continued
in the ministry till recently. At the present time he
resides in Minnesota, and is practising medicine. At<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
Perrysville, where I had preached monthly for two
years, a meeting-house was erected, and a society
organized. Being in Oxford, Ohio, I met with B. F.
Foster, a young man, who had just commenced
preaching, and prevailed on him to move to Perrysville,
and take charge of the society in that place.
He, however, soon left P. and located in Terre Haute,
where our friends were building a fine meeting-house.
He has resided in Indiana ever since, and is a popular
and useful minister. He has been for many years
pastor of the society in Indianapolis, and at the present
time he is State Librarian.</p>

<p>An Association, embracing the country from Terre
Haute to Lafayette, called the Wabash Valley Association,
was organized. The meeting that organized
it was held in Perrysville, and it was an enthusiastic
gathering. Seven or eight societies were represented,
all recently formed. Many went on horseback, in
wagons and carriages, thirty, forty, and fifty miles.
Our friends were alive with zeal, and did not mind
traveling fifty miles to a good meeting.</p>

<p>The United Brethren held a noisy meeting in Warren
county, and the following lines were very popular
with the Brethren, and they often sung them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The devil is mad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I am glad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><em>Glory, O hallelujah</em>.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The devil may pout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I will shout.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><em>Glory, O hallelujah</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I noticed this meeting, and quoted their popular
hymn in the <em>Teacher</em>, and the Brethren in that county
were very indignant. At their next meeting one
of their preachers took up the matter. “That little
Universalist preacher,” said he, “that lives in Lafayette,
and prints that Universalist paper, is mad because
we sing about his daddy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>I attended, on a dark and gloomy night, a fanatical
camp-meeting of the Methodists, near Ladoga. It was
held in a dense forest. When a mile from the camp,
I heard the noise of the nocturnal worshipers. Arriving
on the ground, the scene that opened to the
vision, beggared description. The whole camp seemed
to be in an uproar. Preachers were preaching,
exhorters exhorting, singers singing, shouters shouting,
and jumpers were jumping. Some seemed to be
suffering intense agony, others as happy as clams at
high water. Some kept their seats, while others were
hopping, skipping and jumping like chickens with
their heads cut off. One man ran past me without
looking to the right or left. “Where are you going?”
said I. “To glory.” A preacher screamed
as loud as his lungs would allow, “The devil is in
the camp, and must be driven out. Get the horn,
form in line, march round the ground three times,
blow the horn, the devil must be driven out, the walls
of Jericho shall fall.” The procession was formed,
the horn was blown, and the march was made.
Whether Satan left the camp, and the said walls fell
at this demonstration, the master of the ceremony did
not see proper to inform us. I left the ground about
midnight, when the excitement was under full headway,
and my reflections while walking back to the
village were as follows: Is this the proper way to
worship God? Does he require us to make fools of
ourselves, and act like bedlamites? Is religion fanaticism?
Is regeneration an hallucination? I will not
believe a word of it. Religion consists in love to
God and man. Noise, uproar, fanaticism are not
worship, are not religion, are not regeneration. God
speaks to the soul with the still small voice of inspiration
and intuition, and the truly pious make but little
outward demonstration. Empty wagons make much
noise, heavy laden ones pass our streets without hardly
being heard. But then I do not wonder at the<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
noise, lamentation, agonizing, and every other extravagance,
of these people. They think God is frowning
on this world, that his wrath is kindled to its hottest
pitch, that he has already banished most of the dead
to the infernal regions, and that during every moment
of time crowds are driven from earth to hell,
and that we all stand on the very brink of a bottomless
pit. No wonder the victims of this terrible
belief are nearly insane. Strange they are not all
raving mad. O God, enlighten their minds concerning
thee, whom to know is life eternal.</p>

<p>I visited Michigan City by request, and delivered
four discourses. The Episcopal clergyman of the
place, took the trouble to go around town, and destroy
all the notices of the meetings that were tacked up,
and to tell the people not to go near me. But large
congregations attended, and all seemed much interested.
In one of my lectures I gave a history of the
“rise and progress” of the Episcopal Church. Stated
that it was conceived in sin and brought forth in
iniquity; that Henry VIII., universally admitted to
have been the most beastly monarch that ever reigned
in England, was the first Episcopalian, and the father
of the sect; that church from Henry’s day to this day
has been a proud, arrogant, insolent, overbearing concern;
in England it draws half of its support from
unwilling pockets, from those who belong to other
communions; that it cares not who starves provided
its priests, bishops, and lords live in indolence, race
horses, chase foxes, and drink brandy; it never took
but one short step from the Catholic Church, the
mother of harlots, and it was now creeping back into
the arms of its old mamma; but there are some live
men and women in the church, and they deplore the
stupidity, coldness and old hunkerism of the lifeless
body to which they are bound.</p>

<p>The distance from Lafayette to Michigan City, is
about one hundred miles, and for fifteen miles on<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
each side of the Kankakee river, there was not, in
those days, a house. It commenced raining on my
way to Michigan City, when I had reached the south
margin of that wilderness of prairie, and it poured
down in torrents till I made the first house, thirty
miles distant. It was a swamp nearly all the way,
and the flood of that day made the road, such as it
was, nearly impassable. I sometimes thought I
should have to return; but about ten at night I
reached a cabin, drenched with rain, covered with
mud, and as hungry as a bear.</p>

<p>A Presbyterian elder, by the name of Smith, was
eager for a debate, and he was gratified. We occupied
the Presbyterian church in Dayton, and the
poor elder did one pretty hard day’s work. He was
frightened out of most of his wits; his nerves were
unstrung, and his hand so trembled he could not hold
his Bible to read his texts. I pitied him, but dealt as
hard blows as I could strike. He was disgusted with
himself, and proposed, a few weeks after, to try again,
hoping to do better. We spent two days at Rossville,
near his home, and he then willingly retired
without further debating.</p>

<p>A few days after this affair, I spent four days in
discussion with Mr. Coon, a Scotch Presbyterian, and
Calvinistic “up to the hub.” He was a prominent
man in his church, intelligent, and well educated.
He subsequently published a book of three or four
hundred pages, against the doctrine of the Restitution,
and in defense of eternal punishment. The discussion
was held in Jefferson; and though the weather
was intensely cold, a large number attended. Mr.
Coon was a strong man, and all were anxious to hear.
He had thoroughly prepared himself for the work.
It required two or three men to carry his books to
and from the church. I had my Bible, and perhaps
two or three other books. He talked English, and
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew. Mr. Taylor, a Presbyterian<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
minister, who had just closed an eight days’
debate with John O’Kane, of the Campbellite Church,
was one of the moderators, and he prayed for Mr.
Coon, imploring the Lord to help him on that important
occasion.</p>

<p>“These shall go away into everlasting punishment,
but the righteous into life eternal,” (Matt. xxv. 46,)
was one of his proof-texts. “It is evident,” said he,
“that this passage teaches the endless punishment of
the wicked, for the following reasons: 1. It relates
to what would transpire at the <em>end of the world</em>.
This, and the preceding chapter, is an answer to the
questions, ‘What shall be the signs of thy coming,
and of the <em>end of the world</em>?’ Matt. xxiv. 3. 2.
‘These’ were to go into everlasting punishment when
Christ would come the <em>second time</em>, and that event
was to take place at the end of the world. 3. Everlasting
is from the same Greek word that is rendered
<em>eternal</em>, and consequently the everlasting punishment
is to continue as long as the eternal life. If one will
end so will the other end. 4. The best scholars tell
us, that the Greek word here rendered everlasting
and eternal, signifies <em>endless duration</em>.”</p>

<p>I replied: Mr. Coon tells us, that his text was to
be fulfilled at the end of the world spoken of in Matthew
xxiv. He is doubtless correct. Now, learned
men of all denominations tell us, that <em>world</em> there
means the Jewish Dispensation, and the <em>end</em> of the
world the end of that Dispensation. Most of them
translate the passage, “end of the <span class="allsmcap">AGE</span>.” It is so
rendered by Doddridge, Macknight, Whitby, Pearce,
Le Clerc, Hammond, Wakefield and Kenrick—all
learned men, and save one or two, advocates of endless
misery. The word, <em>world</em> is often used in this
sense in the New Testament. “Now once in the end
of the world hath Christ appeared to put away sin by
the sacrifice of himself.” Heb. ix. 24. Christ did
appear at the end of the Jewish Dispensation for that<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
purpose. The Jews divided time into <em>two ages</em>—the
<em>age before</em> Christ, and the <em>age after</em> Christ. The <em>first
age</em> ended, as Paul says, “when Christ appeared.”
The end of <em>the world</em>, then, took place eighteen hundred
years ago, and <em>then</em> the gentleman’s text was
fulfilled.</p>

<p>2. When Christ was to come the second time, some
were to go away into everlasting punishment. When
was he thus to come? In this same discourse Jesus
speaks of that coming, and affirms, that it would take
place in <em>that generation</em>. “And then shall appear the
sign of the Son of man, ... and they shall see the Son
of man coming.” He then states when he would come:
“This <em>generation</em> shall not pass till all these things be
fulfilled.” Matt. xxiv. 30, 34. On another occasion,
addressing his disciples, he said, “But when they
persecute you in this city, flee ye into another; for
verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over
the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come.”
Matt. x. 27. He would come so soon that the disciples
would not be able to visit all of Israel’s cities.
At another time he said, “For the Son of man shall
come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and
then he shall reward every man according to his
works. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing
here, which shall not taste of death, till they
see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” Matt.
xvi. 27, 28. He was to come the second time before
some who heard these words would die. He intimated
that the apostle John would live to witness this
coming. “Peter seeing John, saith to Jesus, Lord,
what shall this man do? Jesus saith to him, If I will
that he <em>tarry till I come</em>, what is that to thee? Then
went this saying abroad among the brethren, that the
disciple would not die; yet Jesus said not to him, He
shall not die; but, If I will that he <em>tarry till I come</em>,
what is that to thee.” John xxi. 21-23. It requires
considerable effort to misunderstand these plain declarations.<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
Jesus told his hearers, that he would
come the second time, 1. In the generation in
which he lived; 2. So soon the disciples would not
have time to visit all Judah’s cities; 3. Before some
he addressed would die; 4. That John, the beloved
disciple, might live to see him come. In the face of all
this testimony, Mr. Coon tells us, that coming is <em>yet
a future event</em>! But the truth is, that coming took
place at the <em>beginning</em> of the Christian Dispensation,
at the <em>ushering in</em> of the Gospel Age, at the <em>setting
up</em> of the kingdom of God. The revelator, who was
the disciple John, says, he “saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.”
Rev. xxi. 3. Judaism had passed away, Paganism was
dead, and a new order of things had commenced—old
things had passed away, all things had become
new. The world had entered on a <em>new era</em>. This is
what Christ meant by his coming in <em>power</em> and <em>glory</em>.</p>

<p>3. The gentleman truly says, that everlasting and
eternal are from the same original word. He then
<em>assumes</em> that “eternal life” in his text means endless
blessedness, and then <em>infers</em>, that “everlasting punishment”
means endless wretchedness. His assumption
and inference are alike fictions. According to
the New Testament, the Christian, in this world, is in
possession of eternal or everlasting life. “He that
believeth on me <span class="allsmcap">HATH EVERLASTING LIFE</span>.” “Verily,
verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, <span class="allsmcap">HATH EVERLASTING
LIFE</span>, and shall not come into condemnation, but <span class="allsmcap">IS
PASSED</span> from death unto life.” John v. 24. “This is
<span class="allsmcap">LIFE</span> eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” John
xvii. 3. Eternal life is gospel life—<em>spiritual life</em>,
and every Christian man and woman is now in possession
of this life. When a person is <em>alive</em> to every
thing holy and good, possesses the spirit of Christ,
and lives the life of Christ, it may be truly said of<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
him, he “<span class="allsmcap">HATH</span> everlasting life.” So, when a man’s
character is the reverse of this, when he is a son of
error and sin, it may be truly said of him, he <span class="allsmcap">HATH</span>
everlasting punishment. If everlasting life can be
enjoyed here, cannot everlasting punishment be suffered
here? Again, a person may be a Christian to-day,
and consequently in possession of everlasting
life; but his love may wax cold, he may become a
sinner, an unbeliever, an infidel; he will then be no
longer in possession of everlasting life. So, an infidel
and a sinner of to-day may become a saint, like St.
Paul; he then passes from death to life, from suffering
everlasting punishment to the possession of everlasting
life. But, by everlasting punishment, Jesus
had direct reference to the temporal desolation that
was soon to befall his countrymen at the end of the
Jewish Dispensation. The kingdom was to be taken
from them, and they were to be cast out into outer
darkness, till the fullness of the Gentiles should come
in.</p>

<p>4. Mr. Coon informs us, that the Greek terms,
<i lang="grc">aion</i>, <i lang="grc">aionios</i>, mean endless duration. These are two
forms of one word. <i lang="grc">Aion</i> is a noun, and <i lang="grc">ios</i> added
to it, forms the adjective. This word occurs in these
two forms three times in the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth
chapters of Matthew. In the twenty-fourth
chapter, the disciples inquired of Jesus, “What shall
be the sign of thy coming, and of the <em>end of the
world</em>?” These two chapters answer these two questions.
Now, <em>world</em> is from <i lang="grc">aion</i>, the same word rendered
everlasting, and eternal, in the text. There
was then to be an <em>end</em> to <i lang="grc">aion</i>. Mr. Coon tells us,
that this word means <em>duration without end</em>, and in
the same speech cites the same word to prove that it
(<i lang="grc">aion</i>) is to <em>end</em>! One passage explains the other.
In one place Jesus speaks of <i lang="grc">aionios</i> punishment,
without stating whether he means endless or limited
time; in the other place the apostles inquire concerning<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
the <em>end</em> of the <i lang="grc">aion</i>, and Jesus in answering
their question, tells them, that it <em>shall end</em>, “but,” he
adds, “the <em>end</em> is not yet.” Many things would
transpire before that event would occur. “He that
endureth to the <em>end</em> shall be saved.... And the gospel
of this kingdom shall be preached in all the world
for a witness to all nations; and then shall the <em>end</em>
come.... Verily, verily, I say unto you, <em>this generation</em>
shall not pass, <em>till all these things be fulfilled</em>.”
Matt. xxiv. 6, 13, 14, 34. We have, then, the word
of Jesus for it, that <i lang="grc">aion</i>, and consequently, <i lang="grc">aionios</i>,
everlasting punishment, may end. I will give the
true definition of <i lang="grc">aion</i>, according to learned men—all
believers in endless woe:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schleusner.</span>—“Any space of time, whether longer
or shorter, past, present, or future, to be determined
by the persons or things spoken of, and the
scope of the subject—the life or age of man; any
space in which we measure human life, from birth to
death.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donnegan.</span>—“<i lang="grc">Aion</i>, time; a space of time; lifetime
and life; the ordinary period of man’s life; the
age of man; man’s estate; a long period of time;
eternity. <i lang="grc">Aionios</i>, of long duration; eternal, lasting,
permanent.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schrevelius.</span>—“<i lang="grc">Aion</i>, an age, a long period of
time; indefinite duration; time, whether longer or
shorter, past, present or future; life, the life of man.
<i lang="grc">Aionios</i>, of long duration, lasting, sometimes everlasting,
sometimes lasting through life.”</p>

<p>This is the definition learned men give the word.
I will now show that the Bible attaches the same
meaning to it.</p>

<p>1st. <em>Everlasting.</em> “And I will give unto thee and
thy seed, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession.” Gen. xvii. 8.</p>

<p>“And I will make of thee a multitude of people,
and will give this land (Canaan) to thy seed after<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
thee, for an everlasting possession.” Gen. xlviii. 4.</p>

<p>Now, was this possession to be endless? No, for
it ceased long ago! But let me read still more:
“Unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills”—“The
everlasting mountains were scattered.” Hab.
iii. 6. The gentleman believes that the everlasting
hills and mountains will all be destroyed when the
world comes to an end!</p>

<p>“For their anointing shall surely be an everlasting
priesthood.” Exod. xl. 15. “And he (Phinehas) shall
have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant, for
an everlasting priesthood.” Num. xxv. 13. “And
this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make
an atonement for the children of Israel once every
year.” Lev. xvi. 34. Was the priesthood to be of
endless duration? or has it not long since been abolished
by the priesthood of Christ? Such, my friends,
is a sample of the Bible use of this word.</p>

<p>2d. <em>Forever.</em> “He (Solomon) shall build me an
house, and I will establish it forever.” 1 Chron. xvii.
12. This house although established forever, was
long since torn down and destroyed! “For the
land which thou seest, to thee (Abram) will I give it,
and to thy seed forever.” Gen. xiii. 15. “You will
keep it (the passover) a feast by an ordinance forever.”
Exod. xii. 14. Was the observance of the
passover to be of endless duration? “They shall be
your bondsmen forever.” Lev. xxv. 46. Were they
to be bondsmen throughout duration? “I went to
the bottom of the mountains; the earth with her bars
was about me forever”—that is, three days! Jonah
ii. 6. “The righteous shall inherit the land, and
dwell therein forever.” Ps. xxxvii. 29. Are the
righteous to dwell in a land endlessly? “And his
master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he
shall serve him forever,”—that is, as long as he live.
Exod. xxi. 6. “And they shall dwell in the land that
I have given my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
have dwelt, and they shall dwell therein, forever;
and my servant David shall be their prince forever.”
Ezek. xxvii. 25. This needs no comment. “But
Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation
to generation,”—from <i lang="grc">genea</i> to <i lang="grc">genea</i>. “For I
have told him that I will judge his house forever, for
the iniquity which he knoweth.” Will the Almighty
be endlessly judging the house of Eli? And if to
judge forever does not mean endless judgment, why
should to punish forever mean endless punishment?
Can any one tell? Paul, writing to Philemon, says
of Onesimus,—“For perhaps he departed for a season,
that thou shouldst receive him forever”—not
endlessly, surely!</p>

<p>This noted passage, then, affords no evidence that
punishment will be inflicted duration without end.
Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great moralist and writer of
the last century, speaking of this passage, and others
of like character, says: “They may admit of a mitigated
interpretation.”</p>

<p>The discussion continued four days—closed Saturday
evening. I delivered a <em>practical</em> discourse on
Sunday morning, made no reference to the debate,
and at the close organized a society. Mr. Coon
preached in the afternoon, and the discussion was his
<em>text</em>. He misrepresented me, the good faith, and
poured out volleys of abuse on all who did not subscribe
to his fire and brimstone creed. I replied in
the evening, and handled Calvinism without gloves,
but he kept out of the way.</p>

</div>

<p>When in Dayton on one occasion to fill an appointment,
I heard J. O’Kane preach an excellent sermon—it
was all Universalism. His subjects were the
Mosaic and Christian covenants. Moses was the
head of the first, and Christ the head of the second
covenant; the blessings of the first were <em>temporal</em>,
and were designed only for the <em>Jews</em>; the blessings
of the second were <em>spiritual</em>, including the <em>forgiveness
of sin</em> and <em>life everlasting</em>, and were designed for
<em>all nations</em>. The whole Jewish nation was blessed
temporally, and all nations, families and kindred
would be blessed spiritually. He dwelt long and emphatically
on these points—proved and illustrated
them in a very satisfactory manner. My friends evidently
thought that was pretty good Universalism, as
it certainly was. But I was satisfied that it was all a
<em>blind</em>, and I resolved to quiz him a little. As soon as
he was through, I asked the privilege to propound a
few questions, and stated I should be much pleased
if he would answer them.</p>

<p>“Ask as many questions as you please, and I shall
be sure to answer them,” said he, in not a very agreeable
tone.</p>

<p>“I understood you to say that the blessings of the
Christian covenant are for all mankind, and that all
nations, families and kindreds of the earth would<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
surely participate in those blessings. Did I understand
you correctly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I also understood you, that the blessings of said
covenant are spiritual—the forgiveness of sin and
life everlasting. Did I understand you correctly?”</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“Once more. Do you believe that all nations, families
and kindreds will be blessed by having their sins
forgiven, and with life everlasting?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t,” said he, in an angry tone.</p>

<p>“But why equivocate? You have just said you
did believe this.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I said.”</p>

<p>Mr. O’Kane was in a pretty tight place, for it was
well known, that he was a staunch advocate of eternal
woe. Why he delivered such a discourse was best
known to himself. Perhaps he hoped to catch some
of our brethren by pretending to be with them in
faith.</p>

<p>Subsequently, he replied to a discourse I delivered
in Crawfordsville, from these words: “Marvel not at
this; for the hour is coming in the which all that are
in their graves shall hear his voice, and they shall
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation.” John v. 28, 29. There
are, I remarked, three distinct resurrections spoken
of in the Bible—a temporal, a moral, and an immortal
resurrection. When the Bible speaks of a resurrection,
we must learn from the context of the passage,
which of those resurrections is intended. I will
briefly notice some passages where these three resurrections
are spoken of.</p>

<p>In Ezekiel, thirty-seventh chapter, the prophet is
writing of the return of the Jews to Palestine from
Babylon, where they had been enslaved for seventy
years. The chapter is headed—“The resurrection of<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
dry bones.” I will cite the whole passage: “The
hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out
in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the
valley which was full of bones, and caused me to
pass by them round about; and, behold, there were
very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were
very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can
these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God,
thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy
upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones,
hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God
unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter
into you, and ye shall live; and I will lay sinews
upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied,
there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and
the bones came together, bone to his bone. And
when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up
upon them, and the skin covered them above; but
there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me,
Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, Son of man, and
say unto the wind, Thus saith the Lord God: Come
from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these
slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he
commanded me, and the breath came into them, and
they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding
great army.” Ezek. xxxvii. 1-10. Now mark the
explanations: “Then he said unto me, Son of man,
these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold,
they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost:
we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, O
my people, I will open your graves, and bring you
into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I
am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my
people, and brought you up out of your graves. And<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
I shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I
shall place you in your own land; then shall ye know
that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it,
saith the Lord.” Ezek. xxxvii. 11-14. This was a
temporal resurrection, and included also a moral resurrection.
It was the return of “the whole house
of Israel” to “the land of Israel from Babylon.”
When in Babylon, they were said to be in their
<em>graves</em>, their <em>hope was lost</em>, but they were to come up
out of the graves, and be restored to their beloved
country.</p>

<p>The same events are also predicted in Daniel xii. 2.
“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the
earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some
to shame and everlasting contempt.” The connection
shows this to be the same kind of a resurrection spoken
of in Ezekiel. That all this was to take place within
a few years, is evident from the following consideration:
1. The previous verse reads thus: “And at
that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
which standeth for the children of thy people: and
there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was
since there was a nation even to that same time; and
at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one
that shall be found written in the book.” Dan. xii. 1.
This prince Michael was a ruler in Persia, while the
Jews were in Babylon. He is spoken of in two
other places in that book. “But the prince of the
kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty
days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came
to help me; and I remained there with the kings of
Persia. But I will show thee that which is noted in
the scripture of truth; and there is none that holdeth
with me in these things, but Michael your prince.”
Dan. x. 13, 21. It is clear from these quotations, that
Michael was a prince of Persia, and that he was living
when the Jews were in Babylon. Mark also, that
the resurrection, there spoken of, was to occur in<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Michael’s lifetime, when Michael “would stand up,”
and consequently it must have taken place long ago.
2. The question was asked, (verse 6) “How long shall
it be to the end of these wonders?” and the answer
given was, “It shall be for a time, times and half a
time,” (verse 7.) In verse 12, the period intended by
these “times” is stated to be “one thousand three
hundred and thirty-five days,” making a little more
than four years. “Time,” singular, means one year,
“times,” plural, three years, “half a time,” six
month. The resurrection, then, referred to, was to
take place between four and five years from the time
the prophet saw the vision—another evidence that this
resurrection was realized in the return of the Jews to
Palestine from the land of their captivity. 3. Daniel
was to live to witness the transpiring of this event.
“Go thy way,” said the angel to Daniel, “till the
end be; for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the
end of these days.” (Verse 13.) It then seems certain,
that this resurrection was to take place within a
few years after Daniel had a vision of it. Two men,
at least, then existing, were to live to witness the
event—Michael, a prince of Persia, and Daniel, a
prophet of the Lord, and to behold it they had to live
only about four years and a half longer. The nation
was raised from its grave, from the dust of the earth,
and those who were loyal through the dark night of
bondage, returned to the land of promise with glory
and honor; but those who were traitors during the
times that tried men’s souls, returned with shame and
contempt.</p>

<p>The Bible also reveals an immortal resurrection.
Says Jesus, whose mission it was to bring life and
immortality to light, “In the resurrection they neither
marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the
angels of God in heaven.... God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living, for all—the dead—live unto
him.” Matt. xxii. 30, 32. This is not a physical,<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
temporal, or moral resurrection, merely, but a resurrection
to eternal life, and a blissful immortality.
The apostle Paul (1 Cor. xv.) dwells long and emphatically
on this glorious resurrection. “As in Adam,”
says he, “all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.... It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory;
it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is
sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.”
“For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and
this mortal must put on immortality. So when this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of
death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But
thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.” 1 Cor. xv. 22, 43, 44, 53-57.</p>

<p>The terms in these passages clearly indicate, that
the immortal resurrection is the subject of discourse;
and that all mankind are interested in it. It is not a
resurrection from the grave, or from the dust of the
earth, for the immortal spirit which now tabernacles
in the flesh, never dies, except morally, never descends
to the grave or dust, except figuratively, but as
the wise man says, “Dust shall return to the earth as
it was; and the <em>spirit</em> shall return unto God that gave
it.” Eccles. xii. 7. The body only dies, it returns to
the dust—the spirit never; it returns to God.</p>

<p>Hence my text must refer to some other kind of a
resurrection, for it speaks of coming up out of graves,
and the connection makes it certain that a <em>moral</em> resurrection
is intended. Immediately preceding the
text, Jesus says, “As the Father raiseth up the dead
and quickeneth them; even so, the Son quickeneth
whom he will.” There is here a comparison between<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
what God was doing, and what Christ was doing.
God was raising the dead from mortality to immortality,
and Jesus was raising the morally dead and
quickening them by his spirit. He continues to
speak of the moral resurrection he was then effecting:
“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth
my word, and believeth on him that sent me, <em>hath</em>
everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation;
but is passed from death unto life.” Those
whom Christ had quickened by the truth were in
possession of “everlasting life,” had actually “passed
from death to life”—of course, no other than a moral
resurrection is intended. He continues: “Verily, I
say unto you, The hour is coming, and <span class="allsmcap">NOW IS</span>, when
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live.” Sinners, the morally dead,
were then hearing his voice and coming forth to life.
This is <span class="allsmcap">NOW</span> going on, said Jesus. Then he adds:
“Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the
which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
and they shall come forth; they that have done good,
unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” The connection
decides that Jesus was speaking of the moral
resurrection he was then effecting among the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. During Christ’s ministry
the gospel was proclaimed only to the Jews, and they
only came forth and were blessed by its quickening
power; but soon the gospel was to be preached to
“all nations,” “to every creature.” Said Jesus to
the disciples, just before he returned to God, “Go ye
into all the world and preach the gospel to every
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.”
Mark xvi. 15, 16. This is the same subject spoken
of in my text. When the disciples went into the
world in obedience to their master, they found mankind
dead in trespasses and sins, buried in the graves<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
of moral degradation, even in the dust of the earth.
They preached the gospel to the dead nations—some
who heard it, came forth to life, to salvation, entered
the kingdom of God, which is righteousness, joy and
peace in the holy spirit. Others, who heard it, came
forth to condemnation, and this is explained thus:
“He that believeth not shall be damned;” “He that
doubteth <span class="allsmcap">IS</span> damned;” “<span class="smcap">Having</span> damnation because
they cast off their first faith;” “He that believeth
not is condemned <span class="allsmcap">ALREADY</span>.” Similar results have
followed the proclamation of the truth in all ages and
climes. Let the truth be proclaimed fully and plainly
in an ignorant and vicious community, and some with
joy will receive it, and partake of its blessedness;
others will rise up in opposition to it, condemn it, and
wax worse and worse.</p>

<p>This was the substance of the discourse, but much
more was said in defense of the various points here
briefly stated. Mr. O’Kane replied, but I have room
for only one of his criticisms.</p>

<p>“The speaker said, that in the immortal resurrection,
the dead are not said to be raised from the <em>graves</em>,
and hence in John v. 28, 29, Christ does not speak of
such a resurrection, for he there tells us, that the dead
shall be raised from the graves. Now, it happens, that
in the very chapter the gentleman informs us teaches
the immortal resurrection, the apostle Paul does teach
that the dead on that occasion will be raised from the
<em>grave</em>. ‘So,’ says he, ‘when this corruptible shall
have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have
put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
O death, where is thy sting? O <em>grave</em>, where
is thy victory?’ Now which is correct, Mr. Manford
or the apostle Paul, for they contradict each other.”</p>

<p>I replied, Mr. O’Kane has my thanks for pointing
out what he deems an error in my discourse. The
word <em>graves</em> in John v. 28, is from <i lang="grc">muemeia</i>, which<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
signifies grave, the receptacle of dead bodies, but the
word <em>grave</em> in Corinthians, is from <i lang="grc">hades</i>, which
means, not the grave, but the state of the dead. The
meaning of the two terms are very different. One
signifying the <em>place</em> where dead bodies are deposited,
but the other, the state of the dead. Now the body
is not buried in <i lang="grc">hades</i>, but it is buried in <i lang="grc">muemeia</i>,
and at the immortal resurrection the dead come not
from <i lang="grc">muemeia</i>, but from <i lang="grc">hades</i>, the state of death.
My remark then was strictly correct, that at the immortal
resurrection nothing is said about the dead
being raised from the grave, <i lang="grc">muemeia</i>. The state
of the dead is designated by <i lang="grc">hades</i>, and that state or
condition may continue but a moment. The term
has no reference to time or place, but merely to death.
When a person dies, his condition is represented by
<i lang="grc">hades</i>, and when the spirit returns to God, it is delivered
from <i lang="grc">hades</i>, meaning the state of death. When
the spirit ascends to God, it can exclaim, “Death is
swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be
to God who giveth us the victory.” “Victory, victory,
victory!” they exclaim, as they burst the shackles
of <i lang="grc">hades</i>, or the state of the dead, and join the
immortal band in the land of the blessed.</p>

<p>I delivered two discourses in West Lebanon, and
spent most of one day in conversation with Mr. Cooper,
a Methodist minister. Said Mr. Cooper, “You
say, forever and everlasting in the Bible signify limited
duration. The Bible speaks of the ‘everlasting
God,’ and the ‘everlasting life’ of the saints. Now,
according to your definition of these words, God will
exist only for a limited period, and the redeemed in
heaven will exist only for a limited period. Your
definition dethrones God, and blots out heaven.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my friend. True, the primary meaning
of those words is duration, indefinite duration,
but how long cannot be determined by the words, but<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
by the subjects of discourse. When the Bible speaks
of the ‘everlasting hills,’ ‘everlasting priesthood of
Aaron,’ ‘the everlasting possession’ of Judea by
the Jews, ‘the everlasting doors’ of the temple,
‘the servant serving his master forever,’ you readily
admit that those words in those places mean limited
time. You admit this, because the subjects of discourse
are limited in their duration. But when those
words are applied to God, and man’s immortal inheritance,
they signify unlimited duration, because of
the subjects to which they are applied. But why
should everlasting and forever, when applied to punishment,
bear the meaning they do when related to
God and immortal life, rather than the signification
they bear when applied to the priesthood, the hills, or
the temple?”</p>

<p>“I admit, that when those words are applied to
man in <em>this world</em>, they signify limited time, but
when the Bible speaks of man being punished forever,
and suffering everlasting punishment in the
<em>immortal world</em>, they must mean the same they do
when it speaks of the everlasting blessedness of the
saints in heaven, and joys forevermore at God’s right
hand. Take, for instance, the words of Christ, ‘These
shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into life eternal.’ Now this life and this
punishment pertain to the immortal world, and one
will continue as long as the other.”</p>

<p>“But it is by no means certain, that Jesus refers to
heaven or hell beyond the grave. The connection
clearly shows, that Christ had reference to the blessedness
of the subjects of the gospel kingdom, and the
wretchedness of those out of that kingdom, out of the
ark of safety. In the connection of the passage, he
says, ‘Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.’ The life spoken of in your text is the life,
the blessedness of this kingdom, and the New Testament<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
certainly teaches, that the kingdom is established
in this world. When John commenced his ministry
he said, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of God is at
hand.’ When Jesus began his work, he repeated
what John had said before him, ‘Repent, for the
kingdom of God is at hand.’ Soon after this Jesus
said, ‘If I cast out devils by the spirit of God, then
the kingdom of God is come unto you.’ Again said
Jesus, ‘The law and the prophets were until John;
since that time the kingdom of God is preached,
and every man presseth into it.’ Near the close of
our Lord’s ministry the Pharisees inquired of him
when the kingdom would come, which he and John
sometime before said was at hand. Now, observe his
reply: ‘Neither shall ye say, lo here, or lo there, for
behold the kingdom of God is within you,’ or about,
or among you, as some, and very correctly, translate
the passage. The apostle Paul defines this kingdom
thus: ‘The kingdom of God is not meat and drink,
but righteousness, joy and peace in the holy spirit.’
These citations inform us where and what this kingdom
is. It is the kingdom of truth and righteousness,
that Jesus built up in this world eighteen hundred
years ago. It is called the kingdom of God
because its principles are all divine; because the Son
of God is its king, and to distinguish it from the political
kingdoms of earth. In this world there are three
kingdoms, and three lifes corresponding with those
kingdoms: 1st, The kingdom of nature; and the life
corresponding with it is physical life; 2d, The civil
kingdom; and the life corresponding with it is political,
or civil life; 3d, The kingdom of God, and its
life is spiritual life. You perceive, then, that in the
passage you cite, Jesus refers not to heaven or hell
beyond the grave, but to the blessedness of that kingdom
he labored to build up in this world. When the
New Testament speaks of the immortal world, and
heavenly blessedness, it employs different terms.<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
When Jesus speaks on those sublime themes, he says,
‘In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given
in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven;’
and the apostle Peter calls immortality ‘An inheritance,
undefiled, and fadeth not away;’ and the apostle
Paul says, ‘This mortal shall put on immortality,
and as we bear the image of the earthy we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.’ Remember then,
that a future state of joy or sorrow was not the theme
of Jesus on this occasion.”</p>

<p>“But, sin, according to the Bible, will continue as
long as virtue, misery as long as happiness, death as
long as life, and therefore forever and everlasting
when applied to one class must mean as long as when
applied to the other class.”</p>

<p>But my friend, are you sure, that sin, error, misery,
and death, will continue as long as virtue, truth, happiness,
and life? I take it, that nothing is immortal
save what harmonizes with the divine character.
For a wise purpose, things may have a temporary
existence, that are antagonistic to God’s character.
They may answer some useful end in the economy of
the universe; but when that end shall be gained, they
will disappear. The earthquake rends the earth, the
lightnings flash, the storm howls, the rain falls, for
useful purposes, and those attained, they cease; and
their temporary existence, as they result in immense
good, is reconcilable with infinite goodness. But an
everlasting earthquake from pole to pole, eternal lightning,
blowing and raining, would be antagonistic to
infinite wisdom and goodness. So, moral storms and
earthquakes answer a useful purpose in this world,
and when that end shall be realized, they will cease.
But the existence of sin and wrong eternally would
conflict more with the wisdom and goodness of God,
than everlasting temporal evils, as the former blast the
soul, while the latter only blast the body. As earthquakes
are less frequent than they were in the past<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
ages, and now seldom do much harm, and will probably
continue to diminish, and finally cease to rend the
earth, so moral evil is slowly losing its sway, and its
strength will doubtless continue to grow less and less,
till righteousness shall cover the earth as the waters
cover the deep. By beautiful analogies we are taught
in the Bible, that all sin and wrong will end. “And
it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy,
even every one that is written among the living in
Jerusalem: when the Lord shall have washed away
the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have
purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof
by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
And the Lord will create upon every dwelling
place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud
and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire
by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defense.”
Isa. iv. 3-5. “The wolf also shall dwell with the
lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
and a little child shall lead them. And the
cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like
the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole
of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand
on the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be
full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover
the sea.” Isa. xi. 6-9. “For my thoughts are not
your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and
my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain
cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth
not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower,
and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return unto
me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please,
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with
peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth
before you into singing, and all the trees of the field
shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall
come up the fir tree, and instead of the briar shall
come up the myrtle tree; and it shall be to the Lord
for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be
cut off.” Isa. lv. 8-13. These are elegant passages,
perfect word-painting, and you see they teach the end
of all wrong, and the universal reign of truth and
all righteousness.</p>

<p>About this time I made a long journey south—down
the Wabash river to Terre Haute, thence to Indianapolis,
Richmond, Madison, and the Green River
region, in Kentucky. The distance to and from was
nine hundred miles, was absent three months, and
delivered seventy-three sermons. The whole journey
was performed by my favorite mode of locomotion—on
horseback. I spoke in many places where the
faith I advocated had not before been publicly defended,
and, of course, met with much opposition. In
Portland, a preacher in the midst of my sermon said,
“That is a lie!” and left the house in a great rage.
“Stop!” said I, “my friend, and sustain, if you can,
your charge. I will yield the floor.” “I will have
nothing to do with you; and I warn you to flee from
the wrath to come.” In Boston, near Richmond, an
old lady called aloud for eggs with which to shower
me. But none were furnished. In Perrysville, an
old toper went staggering out of the house, muttering,
“It’s good to live by, but it’s not good to die
by.”</p>

<p>In Shelbyville, a man at the close of a discourse
remarked, that he could see no good reason for living
a christian life if Universalism is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>“My friend,” I replied, “will you answer me a
few questions? If you were sure of heaven would
you put out your eyes? run hot lead into your ears?
Would you not rather wish to see and hear in this
world?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you were sure of being saved, would you not
eat when hungry, and drink when thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you were certain of going to heaven, would
you not love your wife, children, father, mother, brother
and sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you expected to go to heaven when you die,
when you are sick would you not want to recover?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you were sure of being a happy man next year,
would you not want to be happy this year?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you were certain of enjoying good health in
old age, would you not like to have good health now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you were sure of being a true Christian ten
years hence, would you not desire to be a Christian
this year?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“My friend, you have answered your own question
as I would, and as any one would, save a fool. If
eternal life is to be our portion in the other world, we
should lay hold of it in <em>this world</em>. If a heavenly
feast awaits us on the other side of the river, why not
partake of the heavenly feast on <em>this side</em>? But this,
I suppose, puzzles you; you think the Christian is no
better off in this world than the sinner; that he treads
a thorny path, and is crushed by a heavy yoke, hence
the question, Why live a christian life, if after all, I
am sure of heaven? The truth is, the good man, and
only the good man, is truly blessed in this world.<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
He enjoys heaven <em>now</em> in anticipation of one beyond
the grave. This blissful hope transforms his character
into the heavenly image. But there is another
reason why we should live Christians if heaven is
sure. ‘Godliness hath the promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come.’ He who lives
a godly life is not only well paid for it in this world,
but he enters the other world with <em>capabilities</em> for
happiness far exceeding that man who spends this life
in sin and folly. This is an important consideration.
There are then, at least, two reason why we should
be Christians in this world if God has promised that
all shall finally be redeemed. 1st, We are happier in
this world for it; 2d, We shall be happier in the next
world for it.”</p>

<p>In Breckenridge, Ky., bigotry would not allow me
to speak in defense of the truth. One preacher took
special pains to have every door closed against me,
but sin only triumphed for a season; for when I returned
a house was obtained, and I delivered a long
sermon on the sin of bigotry. Showed that it was
the same thing the world over, in all ages and climes,
in christian and heathen lands; that it was as cruel
as an hyena, bloody as a wolf, and remorseless as a
tiger; that it had drenched the earth with gore, and
covered its surface with the slain of human kind; that
it had slain Jesus, the prophets and apostles, and was
still at its wicked work; and the only reason why
bigots are not now crucifying, beheading, hanging,
quartering and burning the saints of the Lord was,
the laws of the land will not let them indulge in such
amusements, but they were doing all they <em>dare</em> do—they
were stabbing character, suppressing free thought,
and persecuting the saints of God. I considerably
extended my acquaintance by this journey, and obtained
many subscribers for the <cite>Teacher</cite>.</p>

<p>Soon after my return, I had a debate with Mr.
Dickerson, of Park county, Ind. He was a Scotch<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
Presbyterian—a Calvinist, and the bluest of the
blue. He contended stoutly, that all God wills to
save, and that Christ died for, will be saved; but,
said he, God wills to save only the elect, and Christ
died only for the elect, and he supposed that they
compose about one tenth of mankind. In one of my
speeches, I remarked:</p>

<p>Mr. Dickerson comes out plainly, boldly, independently,
in favor of old-fashioned Calvinism. He has
no faith in the modern improvements of Calvinism;
he takes it as it flowed from the pen of John Calvin.
He tells us, that God <em>wills</em>, <em>purposes</em> the salvation of
only <em>part</em> of mankind. If he is correct, it seems to
me, the Bible needs revising, for it certainly teaches
that it is the will and purpose of God that all mankind
shall be saved. The apostle Paul expressly says,
“God will have <em>all men</em> to be saved, and to come to
the knowledge of the truth.” 1 Tim. ii. 4. “Having
made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in
himself; that in the dispensation of the fullness of
times he might gather together in one <em>all things</em> in
Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
earth; even in him.” Eph. i. 9, 10. In these passages
the purpose of God in the creation of man is
clearly revealed. It is his will, pleasure and purpose
to save <em>all</em>, to bless <em>all</em> in Christ. Does <em>all</em> mean
<em>part</em>? Is the Bible a riddle? If so, let us finish the
riddle by saying virtue means vice, truth error, happiness
misery, love hatred, life death, salvation damnation,
heaven hell, Christ Belial, and God means devil.
This would be carrying out the interpretation Calvinism
gives the Bible. How a man, standing in the
midst of God’s works, and with the Bible in his hand,
can for a moment assert, that the Author of all these
glories all around, can will and purpose the eternal
wretchedness of nine tenths of mankind, is a problem
of intellectual blindness I cannot solve. Before I can<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
subscribe to such a creed my reason must be destroyed,
my conscience deadened, my eyes put out, my
ears stopped, and my heart become as hard as adamant.
The gentleman says, this is an evidence of my
carnal mindness; and if I could see with spiritual
eyes—he must mean Calvin’s eyes, the eyes that beheld
Michael Servetus, burning on a pile of green
wood—I should be charmed with the beauties of
Calvinism.</p>

<p>2. It was the mission of Jesus to do the will and
purpose of God, and I have proved that it is God’s
will and purpose to save the world—not one here
and there—but the world. Hence the joyous language
of the angels when they announced his birth:
“Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be to <em>all people</em>. For unto you
is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which
is Christ the Lord. And suddenly there was with
the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising
God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men.” Luke ii. 10,
11, 13, 14. This language does not comport at all
with the theory that it was the mission of Jesus to
bless only <em>one tenth</em> of mankind. John, directing
attention to Jesus, said, “Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of <em>the world</em>.” John i. 29.
Said Jesus, concerning his mission, “And I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, will draw <em>all men</em> to me.”
John xii. 32. The apostles understood it to be the
mission of Jesus to save the world—not one tenth
of our race. “We have seen and do testify that the
Father sent the Son to be the Savior of <em>the world</em>.”
1 John iv. 14. “He gave himself a ransom for <em>all</em>,
to be testified in due time.” 1 Tim. ii. 6. “And he
is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only,
but also for the sins of <em>the whole world</em>.” 1 John ii. 2.
“And, having made peace through the blood of his
cross, by him to reconcile <em>all things</em> unto himself; by<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things
in heaven.” Col. i. 20. “God was in Christ, reconciling
<em>the world</em> unto himself.” 2 Cor. v. 19. But
why cite more testimony? I could fill my hour with
quotations from the New Testament, showing that
Christ’s mission was not a partial one, but that it
embraced all the sons and daughters of earth. He
was born the Savior of the world, and he lived, died,
arose, ascended, and still is, the Savior of the world.
That truth corresponds with his spirit, his labors, his
moral precepts, his principles and his prayers. Calvinism
crucifies the true Christ, and sets up an impostor,
an anti-christ, in his stead. It also denies the true
God, and substitutes a monster.</p>

<p>This speech kindled the ire of Mr. Dickerson. He
denounced me in unmeasured terms, and marshaled
all his strength in defense of Calvinism. He was
familiar with its strongest arguments, and he paraded
them to the best advantage. He said Universalism
is Arminianism gone to seed, and he denounced both
systems with much bitterness. This led me to remark—I
believe in all the truth there is in Arminianism
and Calvinism, and there is some truth in both
systems. Calvinism says, that all God wills to save
will surely be saved—not one lost. Very good; I
can say, amen to that. Arminianism says, that God
wills the salvation of <em>all</em>. Very good; I can say,
amen to that. I will put these two truths, and the
sequence from them, in the form of a sylogism:</p>

<p>1. Arminianism—It is God’s will, that all men
shall be saved.</p>

<p>2. Calvinism—God’s will shall be done.</p>

<p>3. Conclusion—All will be saved.</p>

<p>I cast aside the dross of Calvinism and Arminianism,
and retain the pure gold of both systems.</p>

<p>He pitched into my sylogism rough shod, and in
reply, I gave him several from the Bible.</p>

<p>1. It is the will of God that all men shall be saved.<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
Proof: “Who will have all men to be saved.” 1 Tim.
ii. 4.</p>

<p>2. God’s will is to be done. Proof: “He doeth
according to his will in the armies of heaven, and
among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can
stay his hand, or say unto him, what doest thou?”
Dan. iv. 35. “He doeth all things after the council
of his own will.” Eph. i. 11.</p>

<p>3. Conclusion—All will be saved.</p>

<p>1. God purposes the salvation of all men. Proof:
Eph. i. 9, 10, above quoted.</p>

<p>2. God’s purpose will be effected. Proof: “As I
have purposed so shall it stand—for the Lord hath
purposed, and who shall disannul it?” Isa. xiv. 24,
27. “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I
have purposed it, I will also do it.” Isa. xlvi. 11.</p>

<p>3. Conclusion—All will be saved.</p>

<p>1. All were given to Christ. Proof: “Thou has
given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal
life to as many as thou has given him.” John
xvii. 2.</p>

<p>2. All shall be saved who were given to Christ.
Proof: “All that the Father giveth me shall come to
me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
away.” John vi. 37.</p>

<p>3. Conclusion—All will be blessed with eternal
life.</p>

<p>About this time, I held an oral discussion in Chambersburg,
Fountain county, with a Baptist minister—have
forgotten his name. I arrived in due time, but
my opponent did not make his appearance. There
was a large assembly, in a beautiful grove; and after
waiting about one hour, another minister took his
place, and the discussion proceeded. He made one
speech, and while I was replying the expected man
made his appearance. When I was through he proposed,
that each of us make one speech, and then
close the debate; but I insisted that we should occupy<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
two days according to agreement. He was rather a
weak brother; but he knew the book of Revelation
from A to izzard, and all the other mysterious portions
of the Bible. He could tell how deep was the “bottomless
pit,” how large was the “red dragon,” how
big was his “head,” “horns,” and “crown;” could
give the exact length of his “tail,” that cast to earth
the “third part of the stars of heaven.” He was
deeply versed in all that kind of lore, but drank
shallow draughts of useful knowledge or common
sense. But a large number attended the discussion,
and I had an excellent opportunity to talk to the
people.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1843, I moved the <cite>Teacher</cite> to Terre Haute,
ninety miles down the Wabash river, as I deemed
that place a better location than Lafayette for its publication.
Also made that town my head-quarters.
The country north and west of Lafayette, in those
days, was thinly settled, but in the southern portion
of the state, there was a denser population, hence a
better field in which to circulate the <cite>Teacher</cite>. I still
continued my monthly circuit on both sides of the
Wabash river, from Terre Haute to Lafayette,
preaching in twenty different places. B. F. Foster
was pastor of the Terre Haute society, and a meeting-house
was being erected in that place. But soon my
services were so urgently demanded west and south
of Terre Haute, that I dropped some of the places on
the circuit, and supplied the wants of friends elsewhere.
I did so with much reluctance, as there was
no one to take my place. There were then thirteen
societies within that circuit where there was not one
when I first visited that region, and one meeting-house
was finished, and two being built.</p>

<p>At the earnest solicitation of Dr. Thompson, of
Fort Wayne, I visited that place, and delivered a
series of discourses. These were the first sermons
on the Restitution ever delivered in that town, and<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
they caused much excitement. An Episcopal clergyman
proposed debating with me, and we accordingly
spent two days in discussion. The assemblies were
large, and, I trust, much good was effected. Dr.
Thompson was a prominent citizen of Fort Wayne,
and an intellectual and christian man. Three years
after, while a candidate for Congress, he died, lamented
universally where he was known. While on that
journey, I preached in Huntington, Wabash, Peru,
and several other places, where Universalism was
hardly ever heard of before.</p>

<p>I took a trip westward into Illinois, and preached
in Elbridge, Paris, Grand View, Brewetts’ Creek,
Bloomfield, Oakland, Charleston, Shelbyville, Cold
Springs, Marshall and Greenup. In not one of these
places had the people heard a discourse in defense of
“the restitution of all things,” and, of course, my
preaching was a great curiosity. In Paris, a minister
lifted up his warning voice, but would not let me occupy
his house to reply. He wanted his people to hear
his side only. I, however, made an <em>expose</em> of his sermon
in the Court-house, to a large assembly, and obtained
a large number of subscribers for the <cite>Teacher</cite>.
In Oakland, I found some excellent friends, and subsequently
preached there monthly for two years. In
Charleston, the meetings stirred up sectarianism to its
depths, and a preacher by the name of Tichner dared
me to debate with him. Not being badly frightened
by his bluster, I agreed to debate with him four days.
The first proposition was, “Immortal blessedness is
conditional!”</p>

<p>In my first speech in the morning, I showed the
result of the position, that immortal blessedness is
conditional in the sense Mr. Tichner intended. If he
is correct, I remarked, but a small portion of mankind
will ever partake of that blessedness. 1. All
children, dying in childhood, are lost, as they comply,
in this world, with no conditions. 2. Idiots neither<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
believe nor obey the gospel in this world—comply
with no conditions here—and will never, consequently,
partake of immortal blessedness. 3. All who
lived and died before Christ’s advent, complied with
no gospel condition, hence all those countless millions
are lost—forever lost. 4. Pagans, Jews, Mahometans,
since Christ’s day, have all gone down to their
graves, without faith in Christ or the gospel, and
therefore they are all lost beyond redemption. My
friend is a Campbellite, and will not admit that any
comply with gospel conditions, who are not immersed
in water—down then goes Catholics, Methodists,
Presbyterians, Episcopalians, yea, all who are not
immersed. If he is correct, only one here and there
will be saved, while the mass of mankind, nearly all,
will be doomed to suffer immortal agony, for one of
his propositions affirms the endless punishment of the
unsaved. The gentleman may not believe all this—I
cannot say how that is—but I am dealing with his
proposition; and it involves the ruin of nearly all
mankind. I once heard him deliver a sermon on the
conditions of salvation, and in that discourse he did
not intimate that one could be saved without immersion.
His creed unchurches all but his little sect, and
sends all to perdition but his party.</p>

<p>He had another speech to make before adjournment,
and he occupied only half of his allotted time,
but said not a word about what I had shown to be
the result of his proposition. In my reply, I called
attention to my former speech, and to the fact that no
attempt had been made to refute it, and remarked,
that the gentleman must either show that my deductions
are false, or abandon his proposition. He must
do one or the other. He dared me to debate with
him, boasted that he would annihilate my faith the
first day before noon, and many of his friends are
here to see him do it. We adjourned till two o’clock
in the afternoon. Met according to adjournment.<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
Mr. Tichner and his friends were in trouble. They
knew not what to do. They saw that I had their man
in my grasp, and meant to hold him. I looked on,
but said nothing. Finally, one of his brethren came
to me, and admitted that I had the advantage of
brother Tichner, and wished me to release him. The
preacher looked blue; he did not know which way to
turn. I pitied him, and proposed that we drop the
first proposition, which we were to debate two days,
and take up the second proposition—“Will all mankind
enjoy immortal blessedness?” He readily consented,
and the discussion then went on. Mr. Tichner
and his friends were much mortified at the result
of the debate. He soon ceased preaching, went to
California, and made shipwreck of his faith and character.</p>

<p>I lectured in Greenup; and while there, a preacher
prayed the Lord, either to convert the Universalists,
or send them to hell, and he did not seem to care
which disposition was made of them. A Presbyterian
minister in Grand View, delivered a labored sermon
against “Infidelity in all its forms,” and, of
course, “the grace of God which bringeth salvation
to all men,” was one of its worst “forms.” “That
phase of infidelity,” said he, “is the best baited of
the whole batch. Read not their books, their papers,
their <cite>Teacher</cite>—hear not their preachers, talk not on
that subject with any of the believers in that damnable
system. Pray for them, but don’t talk with them.
It is a heresy hot from hell, and have nothing to do
with it.” A Methodist divine in Shelbyville, gave
notice that he would, the Lord permitting, preach a
sermon against Universalism, the next Sunday. But
notwithstanding this opposition, I thanked God and
took courage. Many rejoiced in the testimony they
heard, and resolved that their lives should correspond
with the purity of their new faith.</p>

<p>Being in Green Castle, Ind., I heard a discourse by<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
James Mathes, concerning the conditions of salvation,
and at its close, I delivered, at his request, a
short sermon. Without controverting any of his
positions, I attempted to show, that all mankind
would finally comply with gospel conditions of salvation.
When I got through, he proposed a debate on
the subject of my discourse. In due time we met in
Green Castle, and devoted two days to the investigation
of that subject. Mr. Mathes was, and still is, a
prominent man in his denomination. He said in the
discussion, “There are three conditions of salvation:
1st, Faith; 2d, Baptism; 3d, Repentance. He, and
he only, who complies with these conditions, is entitled
to salvation.”</p>

<p>I answered, If the gentleman on the other side is
correct, but a small squad of mankind will be saved,
for he earnestly denies, that any one can comply with
one of the conditions named, in the other world. We
must believe, repent, be immersed in this world, or
be lost forever; no opportunity for salvation will be
granted beyond the grave; God’s mercy is confined
to this life, but his vengeance will extend through
eternity; his mercy is only the evanescent spark of a
flint, but his wrath will burn forever; this life is only
the infancy of our existence, but his creed makes it
the hinge on which our destiny turns; now, man is a
moral agent, but death will destroy that agency, and
he will be compelled to lie down in sin and darkness
through the eternal ages; death bounds God’s mercy—beyond
it, the righteous will need no mercy, and
the wicked will be allowed none. I cannot subscribe
to such a partial, malignant and cruel creed. I believe
in conditions of salvation, and that a soul will never
be deprived of complying with those conditions.
The conditions, in sum and substance, are, knowledge
of the truth, and love to God, and love to man; and
no one can be saved in this world or in the next world
without that knowledge and love. That is the strait<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
and narrow way; there is no other way to be saved
in time or eternity. True, all do not possess that
knowledge, or exercise that love in this world, but as
the light and heat of the sun are not confined to this
world, but extend to all the worlds in the solar system,
so God’s mercy is not exhausted on earth, but
extends to all time, and to all worlds.</p>

<p>It is certainly God’s will that all shall be saved and
come to the knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim. ii. 4.)
The gentleman, though, denies that truth in toto.
True, he admits, that it is God’s will that you, and I,
and all who now live on earth, shall be saved, but he
contends that all the sons of error and sin, as soon
as they leave this world, are deprived of all power,
of all opportunity, to reform their lives, and must lie
down in sin and error eternally. But mark the text,
“God will have all men to be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth.” It is God’s will now that
all shall be saved. God is unchangeable; he is the
same yesterday, to-day and forever. Men may
change their will, purpose, but his will, his purpose,
is the same through all time, through all eternity. It
was God’s will six thousand years ago, that all should
be saved; it is God’s will now that all shall be saved;
it will be God’s will six thousand years hence, yea,
through the eternal ages, that all men shall be saved,
and come to the knowledge of the truth. As it is
God’s will now, that all shall be saved, all are now
capable of salvation—none are reprobated, none are
cast away; and as it always will be God’s will that all
shall be saved, all ever will be capable of salvation—none
will be reprobated, none cast away. What is
true of God’s nature, character, and will now, ever
will be true of God’s nature, character and will, hence
the golden gates of salvation ever will be open to
mankind. We read that the heavenly city has gates
all around it, on the east, west, north and south, and
that they are never shut by day or by night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>I know it is a very common notion, and Mr. Mathes
preaches it, that the ignorant and vicious will have no
opportunity to become wiser or better in the other
world; that as they breathe their last breath, and
heave their last sigh, they will be compelled to remain
forever. And to prove this monstrous dogma,
I have heard persons repeat such home-made texts as
these: “As the tree falls so it shall lie;” “As death
leaves us, so judgment finds us;” “If you die in
your sins, where I go ye cannot come.” I need not
inform you, that these are all spurious texts. Perhaps
it will be asked, does not the Bible say, “There
is no repentance in the grave?” Nothing of the kind
is in the Good Book. And even if it were there it
would not contradict my position. What is in the
grave? Nothing but the body, and that cannot repent,
in the grave or out of it, dead or alive. Where
is the spirit when the body is mouldering in the
grave? The wise man informs us, “Dust returns to
dust as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave
it.” This is the destiny of <em>all</em>. The body is from
the earth, the spirit from God, and when the copartnership
between the body and the spirit are dissolved,
the body descends, and the spirit ascends; the one to
its mother-earth, and the other to its Father-God.
Man is a spirit; Christ and the apostles talked to
spirits; I am addressing spirits; all revelation—its
precepts and promises—are addressed to spirits; and
when the great Gentile apostle said, “God will have
all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of
the truth,” he was speaking of all spirits, whether in
this world or in the eternal world, whether in the
body, or in the house not made with hands. I repeat,
wherever a spirit exists <em>unsaved</em>, it is God’s will that
he shall be saved, and God will even work in all to
will and to do his pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathes admits, that it is God’s will that sinners
shall be saved while they are in this world, but<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
he contends that it is his will that sinners in the spirit
world shall <em>not</em> be saved. Now why this difference?
Why is it God’s will that I shall now be saved, and
at the same time his will that I shall not be saved
beyond the grave, if I should there need salvation?
Is not reformation of character a good thing any
where and every where? I take it, that God’s government
is the same in all worlds, and at all times.
It is perfect, and therefore uniform and unchangeable.
He now requires all, and ever will require all, to
learn the truth, and walk in the ways of life, and
therefore he never will <em>compel</em> a soul to lie down in
sin, darkness and death, one moment, in time or
eternity.</p>

<p>When the third volume of the <cite>Teacher</cite> commenced,
it was changed to a quarto form, and issued semi-monthly,
instead of monthly; and James Burt and
J. H. Jordan, became associate editors. Mr. Burt
was recently from the East, where he had preached
several years. He was a good writer, and a worthy
man. He was connected with the paper one year,
when his name, at his request, was dropped, and he
ceased preaching. Mr. Jordan was not a minister,
but a school teacher. He subsequently became a
physician, and at the present time, is editor and publisher
of the Indianapolis (Ind.) <cite>Gazette</cite>, a daily and
weekly paper, conducted with vigor and ability. He
wields a strong pen, and is an influential writer. For
several years, Dr. Jordan assisted me in issuing the
<cite>Teacher</cite>, and his contributions were always perused
with much interest.</p>

<p>I opened a new field about this time, in the southern
part of Indiana. Lectured in Bowling Green.
Oliver Cromwell resided there—a descendant of England’s
great Protector. He was an aged man, intelligent,
and an ardent defender of the liberal faith.
He said the Protector was his great-great grandfather.</p>

<p>A zealous Methodist class leader tried to reply to<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
one of my sermons. “If your faith is correct, why
all this labor? Why form societies, build meeting-houses,
support ministers, or try to serve the Lord in
any way?” I answered thus:</p>

<p>I understand from the gentleman’s remarks, that
he supposes that the fear of hell, and the hope of
heaven, are the only reasons why we should attend to
the duties of life; and according to the confession of
sectarians generally, these are the moving causes of
all their christian efforts; hence their first and last
objection to Universalism is, that it removes all
inducements to live a virtuous life. This degrading
objection is in the mouth of nearly all, from the doctor
of divinity to the most humble member. If we
take them at their word, they organize churches, build
meeting-houses, employ ministers, send missionaries
to the heathen, to escape hell and reach heaven; they
pray, preach, attend meetings, go among the heathen,
to escape hell and reach heaven; they deal justly,
love mercy, and walk humbly before God, to escape
hell and reach heaven. According to their own confession,
these are the only motives that urge them
onward in their christian course. Now, this is all
wrong; they build on a false, dangerous foundation;
they build on the sand; they are influenced, governed
solely by selfish considerations. They work for pay,
and pay they will have or turn rebels. Piety with
them is a ticket past hell into heaven. Now, this is a
wretched foundation for a christian life. In truth,
character built on such a basis, is hay, wood and stubble,
and liable to be consumed at any moment, hence
so much back-sliding among Orthodox church members.
They stand on slippery places.</p>

<p>Universalism lays a better foundation, presents better
motives for living a christian life. It makes a <em>reasonable</em>
appeal to man’s hopes and fears, but its strong
foundation is in <em>principle</em>. It teaches that we should
revere the truth, and practice righteousness, because<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
we love truth and righteousness; should love God
and man because of the goodness of God and the
goodness in man; be truthful because we love the
truth, and deal justly with our fellow men because we
love justice and righteousness. When character is
built on such a foundation, it is as permanent as the
everlasting hills. It takes time to form character of
this kind, but when the work is done, it is well done.
Such persons do not need conversion at every camp-meeting
in their county.</p>

<p>Lectured in Spencer, Gosport, Bloomington, Martinsville,
Morgantown, Franklin, Columbus and Nashville.
In all these places the liberal faith had not
before been preached. But I found in most of them
an elect few who had long cherished it amid all sorts
of opposition. Faithful souls! They were true to
their convictions, though standing alone, targets for
bigots to shoot at. In Bloomington I lectured several
times, and a minister tried to point out my errors, as
he termed the noblest and most glorious of truths.
Mr. Labertew, a merchant, and zealous friend, resided
there. He subsequently built a meeting-house at his
own expense; but there not being sufficient number
of believers to act with him in keeping up meetings,
he sold it. Held a meeting in Gosport; the house
was full, and several hundred were out of doors; and
although the rain poured down in torrents, they
remained through the services. Here I subsequently
had many conflicts with those of the partial faith.
Near Nashville I attended a Fourth-of-July celebration.
After the dinner was over, and the patriotic
speeches made, I gave the people a sermon. Lectured
in Martinsville in the Court-house; a clergyman
replied, and arrangements were made for me to have
a debate in that place with Mr. Scott, a Methodist
presiding elder. It was to continue four days. He
had recently debated with J. Mathes, and coming out
of it victorious, all were sure he would make short<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
work of me, and my faith. But they were disappointed.
Mr. Scott got mad, and left the rostrum,
declaring that he would discuss no more with me.
But the moderators persuaded him to continue the
allotted time. After he got through, another minister
tried his hand at the work, but many thought he fared
worse than his predecessor. Weighing about two
hundred and fifty pounds, and as fat as butter, he
kept in good humor. Lectured in Columbus and
Franklin. In both places I soon after had discussions.
This was a laborious journey, for it was war,
war, from the beginning to the end of it.</p>

</div>

<p>In June, 1844, with buggy and two horses, I commenced
a journey into the northern part of Illinois.
Preached in Newport, Ind., and became acquainted
with several devoted believers in the Restitution.
Lectured on temperance in Perrysville. Related the
following sad story of a family, educated to the “temperate
use” of liquor:</p>

<p>The husband and father was wealthy, educated, and
occupied a prominent position in the community in
which he resided. In his days of vigor, he held
important political and military stations; was an
officer in the last war with Great Britain, and after its
termination, honorably occupied a seat in the legislative
hall of his native state. He was what is called a
“temperate drinker.” His children were instructed
by precept and example to be temperate drinkers.
The decanters were ever full of the choicest liquors,
and all daily partook of the sparkling beverage. All
of them despised intemperance, and hated the sight
of a drunkard. The two sons married into families
equal to their own; and the daughter, an accomplished
lady, was wedded to the man of her choice.
The father, with joy beheld his interesting family settled
around him, highly respected for their intellectual
and moral qualities, and bountifully blessed with
the good things of this world. He was comforted<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
with the reflection that his declining years would be
blessed by virtuous children.</p>

<p>My informant, who had spent his childhood and
youth in the town where this family lived, after several
years absence, returned to the home of his early
life. He repaired to the residence of the venerable
man, where he had spent many happy hours in bygone
days. Enquired for beloved names, for the sons
and daughter, the associates of the morning of his
life. The aged father burst into tears; he wept
aloud; he wrung his hands with anguish. The tale
was all horror that the trembling lips of the old man
related. The daughter had disgraced herself by
intemperance, and was mouldering in a premature
grave. The two brothers were ruined by rum-drinking.
A short time before, the wife of one of them,
after enduring the brutal treatment of her husband
for years, had fled from him while he was in a drunken
fit, and plunged into a pond, and was drowned, to
escape from wretchedness, and the monster. The
wife of the other had left him; she would no longer
live with the brute. One of the sons was at home,
but intemperance had made him a cripple and an
idiot. The mother of the family had long since sunk
into a welcome grave, overwhelmed with sorrow.
The father was descending with grief into the grave.
His expectations were blasted; his hopes were cut off.
His family, in which was centered his affections, and
from whom he expected support and consolation, were
miserably destroyed—part sunk into a dishonored
grave, to hide their shame, and the remainder, outcasts
in the world.</p>

<p>The misfortunes of this family, in all probability,
originated in <em>temperate drinking</em>. The seed of sin
and death was sown by the father, while the children
were under his roof. A taste for intoxicating drinks
was there acquired, and cultivated, and when they
left home, they continued to cherish it, till by degrees<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
it became the ruling passion. The parents and children
reaped a fearful reward. What an awful sin for
parents thus to vitiate the taste of their children!
Let them take warning. They will as surely reap
the reward of their evil doing, as there is a God in
heaven. For so great a sin to go unpunished nature’s
laws must be reversed.</p>

<p>Delivered two sermons in Rainsville. Urged my
brethren to live as becometh believers in the best
religion ever entertained by men or angels. It is all
truth and righteousness, and our character and life
should be truthful and righteous. It is better to be
an Orthodox christian, than a Universalist sinner.
We might as well be without the knowledge of the
truth, as to hold it in unrighteousness. The gospel
blesses those only who practice it; to such only it “is
the power of God unto salvation.” Had a meeting
in Montgomery, Ill., and at the close a Baptist
preacher sung out a reply. It was decidedly funny.
I will not attempt to repeat it, for I cannot do justice
to the subject. Forded the Kankakee river where
the city of Kankakee now stands, but there was no
city there then—nothing but a wild prairie. The
river was deep—deeper than I expected—and there
was imminent danger of horses, buggy, and all, being
washed down stream. Some men on the shore
watched me with much interest, but they could have
rendered me no assistance if I had gotten into difficulty,
as there was no boat near. Lectured in Bourbonais
Grove. It is a French village, and I put up
with the principal man of the settlement. He was a
Catholic, but said he believed what I preached.</p>

<p>On July 3d, in Wilmington, Ill., was married to
Miss H. Bryant, by Rev. W. H. Dean, of Joliet.
This lady is a native of New York, and for a year or
two previous to this date, was one of the Principals
of a seminary in Warrenville, Ill. Left Wilmington
with my charge, to return to Terre Haute. But the<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
windows of heaven opened, and the fountains of the
great deep were broken up. The summer of 1844
will long be remembered in the West, as the summer
of floods, tornadoes, thunder and lightning. The
whole country was inundated, and traveling was very
dangerous business. We came near being swept
away, on crossing a rapid stream, the first day of our
journey. Arriving at the Kankakee river, we found it
past fording, and nothing but a small skiff with which
to cross the stream. The carriage was taken to pieces,
and carried over in parcels, and the horses swam the
river. A few miles south we encountered Beaver
Creek—then a mighty river. Again the buggy was
ferried over by piece-meal, and the horses swam at
the side of the frail bark, I holding them by their
heads. Every slough was a river, which we had to
ford or swim. A few miles from the Iroquois river,
when far from a house, a terrible storm burst on our
heads. There was no shelter, and for about one hour
we were exposed to one of the most violent storms I
ever witnessed. The wind blew a tornado, the thunder
crashed fearfully, the lightning flashed sheets of
fire, the rain and hail poured down in torrents, and to
add to the terror of the scene, the trees came crashing
to the ground, all around us. We finally reached a
house on the bank of the river, and were right glad to
have a roof between us and that wild elemental war.
There we had to remain several days, as it was impossible
to proceed till the waters abated. But I was
very restless, as I had an engagement in Oakland,
Ill., and had barely time to reach there without any
detention. I had agreed to have a discussion in that
place with E. Kingsbury, a Presbyterian minister of
Danville, but that last storm prevented my filling the
engagement.</p>

<p>The bridge across the Iroquois river being washed
away by the flood, the carriage was again taken to
pieces, and ferried over, while the horses swam to the<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
opposite shore. But one of them came near drowning,
as he became entangled in the top of a tree that
had drifted down; he was finally rescued, and we
were soon on the way to encounter more trouble.
Reached the Wabash river bottom, opposite Montezuma,
and found it all inundated—the water from
one to three feet deep. When about half way across,
in attempting to cross a low place on a corduroy
bridge, all under water, and not visible, the water
being so dirty, we missed the middle of the corduroy,
and carriage, horses, bride and bridegroom, went over
the side into the mud and water. The bride, a perfect
hero, stood in the mud and water three feet deep,
holding the frightened horses, while the bridegroom
transferred the baggage from the buggy to the trunk
of a fallen tree, which happily was not far distant.
We finally got out of the slough, in a pretty bad
plight though, and crossed the river on to dry land,
and the next day reached Terre Haute—thus ended
our <em>bridal tour</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsbury, named above, gave notice that he
should deliver a discourse near Oakland, against the
doctrine of the Restitution, and added, that he was
willing I should reply, if I thought proper, at the
close of his sermon. I was in Covington, Ind., the
day before he was to deliver said discourse, and being
detained in crossing the Wabash river till near sundown,
I rode most of the night, and reached the
appointed place a few minutes after he had dismissed
his congregation. I rode seventy miles, between four
o’clock Thursday, and twelve o’clock Friday, without
any refreshment, and with about two hours rest. The
congregation was called together. Mr. Kingsbury
furnished me notes of his sermon, and I spoke two
hours in reply. He replied, and I spoke another
hour. We subsequently spent four days in discussion
in Oakland. Mr. Kingsbury not being perfectly satisfied
with his effort proposed a written debate. He<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
agreed to furnish twelve letters for the <cite>Teacher</cite>.
He wrote five, and then gave up the controversy.</p>

<p>I again visited Northern Indiana; and even extended
my journey into Michigan, preaching wherever
I could gather a congregation. Had some conversation
with an intelligent Indian near Peru, on the
Upper Wabash.</p>

<p>“I no believe in your Bible, or your Jesus Christ—not
a word of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, do you believe in a God, and a
hereafter?”</p>

<p>“That I do. I believe in the Great Spirit, and
that he will take good care of all his children. No
man ever killed him, as your Bible says, man killed
God. He is away beyond the reach of arrow or
cross. Who brought God to life if he was killed?
You tell if you can.”</p>

<p>“The Bible does not say that God was slain. He
is a Great Spirit, and in him we all live, move and
have our being. You say truly, that man cannot
harm him. Jesus Christ was not God, but rather a
divine man; and he was sent here by the Great Spirit
to instruct us in wisdom’s ways. But do you not
think God has sent prophets to this world to instruct
his children?”</p>

<p>“I do. My nation has had prophets. They taught
us to use the bow and arrow; and how to raise corn,
potatoes, and tobacco. We bless the Great Spirit for
those prophets.”</p>

<p>“God is no respecter of persons. He has sent
other nations prophets, and Jesus Christ is one of the
wisest and best he ever gave the world. He taught
that God is a spirit, and that we should worship him
in spirit and in truth; that we are all his children;
that he loves all, is good to all, and ever will be the
Father and friend of man. Do you object to that?”</p>

<p>“All good, but the missionaries no talk so. They
say Jesus is God, and that he was killed to save man<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
from his own wrath. I no understand such stuff, and
I no want to. I no believe God is mad, or that he
was killed to be made good-natured.”</p>

<p>“We perfectly agree on that subject. If you will
examine the New Testament, you will find that it
teaches that Jesus Christ was a prophet of the Great
Spirit, and that he was sent to this world to tell us
how to live. He came not to quench the wrath of
God, or to put out the fires of hell, but to direct our
wayward feet in the path of life and salvation. His
is a glorious work, and we are assured he will do it
well. Your nation has likely had prophets, but acquaint
yourself with this one ere you reject him.”</p>

<p>“You tell me new things. I will read the New
Testament.”</p>

<p>The country south of Fort Wayne is flat, wet, and
in those days was covered with a dense forest, and
the settlers’ cabins were far apart—in some places,
miles apart. I remember, when on this journey, of
traveling a whole day without passing more than
half a dozen houses. It was a dark, gloomy, foggy,
rainy autumnal day, and the roads were in a wretched
condition, in many places nearly impassable, the mud
and water being so deep. When it was nearly dark,
I met an ugly looking fellow, with a gun on his shoulder;
and while inquiring of him about the road, I
heard a distant noise, which seemed to be from some
one in distress. I called his attention to it, and proposed
that we ascertain what was the matter. He
seemed to take no interest in the subject, and walked
off in the opposite direction. I told him he was an
inhuman creature, and that I should try to learn who
was making that noise, for some body was surely in
trouble; and immediately left the road, and plunged
into the thick woods, in the direction whence the
mournful sound proceeded. About a quarter of a
mile from the road, I came to a small opening in the
forest, where was a cabin, and in front of the cabin<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
was a fire, and at the side of the fire was a young
woman ironing clothes, and singing a mournful air as
loud as she could scream. This was the noise I took
to be cries of distress. I learned from her, that the
fellow I had just seen was her husband, and that they
had been married about two weeks, after three weeks
acquaintance. I told her about meeting him in the
road, and that I believed he was not there for a good
purpose, and, moreover, that I was fearful she had
married a scamp. Learning from her that it was ten
miles to the nearest house, I bid her good-by, for I
did not care about stopping long in that locality.
While leading my horse back to the road, for the
underbrush was so thick I could not ride, I heard
several times a slight noise in the woods near me, but
paid no particular attention to it. After much difficulty,
and many scratches, I regained the road. But
had proceeded but a short distance when I became
satisfied that the man I had just seen was following
me, for I could distinctly hear footsteps in the woods
a few rods at the left. The night being very dark I
could not see him, could hardly see my horse; and
the mud being deep, and the horse tired, I could
travel only at a slow gait. I stopped my horse, and
peered into the dark, but nothing could be seen. The
rascal came to a halt when I stopped. I dismounted
on the right side of the horse, having him between
me and the villain. Stood there, perhaps, fifteen
minutes, without either party making the least noise,
expected every moment to hear the crack of his gun.
He finally made tracks <em>from</em> me as fast as he could
run, and I remounted my horse and proceeded on my
journey. He doubtless intended to rob me, steal my
horse, and perhaps do worse; but presuming I was
armed—but I was not—and seeing I was pretty
resolute, he did not dare attack me without being
sure of decided advantage. Being on that road again
soon after, I learned that he had fled to parts unknown,<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
leaving his wife, to escape being arrested for
some crime.</p>

<p>The next day I reached Anderson, and delivered
five discourses before I left. At the close of one of
the sermons, a Methodist minister replied. He dwelt
long on the words of the apostle Paul, “As it is
appointed unto men once to die and after that the
judgment.” Heb. ix. 28. I answered:</p>

<p>If the gentleman is correct in his understanding of
this passage, it demolishes one tenet of Orthodoxy.
The passage asserts, that “it is <em>appointed</em> unto men
once to die.” Now, the creeds tell us, that temporal
death is <em>not</em> of divine appointment, but rather contrary
to the divine will. Man, say the creeds, was created
<em>immortal</em>, and it was the will of God that he should not
die; it was the divine appointment, that he should live
forever. But in an evil hour, Adam, the first man,
sinned, and brought temporal death on himself and
on all his posterity, contrary to the divine appointment.
If partialism is right here, this passage does
not refer to temporal death; and if it does refer to
temporal death, it is wrong in denying that temporal
death is of divine appointment.</p>

<p>To what “men” does the text refer? for it does
not say <em>all</em> men are appointed to die. Read the second
verse following: “For the law having a shadow
of good things to come, and not the very image of the
things, can never with those sacrifices which <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>
offered year by year continually make the comers
thereunto perfect.” The pronoun “they” in this
verse, as any one can see, refers to the “men” spoken
of in the text. The apostle says, “they,” that
is, the “men,” “offered sacrifices.” Now, all men do
not offer sacrifices, neither are they required to. But
under the Jewish law, a certain class of men were
appointed to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people.
They were the <em>priests</em>, and it is to them, and to them
only, the text refers. According to the grammatical<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
structure of the text and context, the “men” were
a class whose business it was to offer sacrifices. It is
certain, then, that the apostle does not speak of all
men, but of a certain class of his countrymen. And
this is confirmed by the fact, that in the Greek, the
article <i lang="grc">tois</i> is before the word men, and that article
means <em>the</em> or <em>these</em>. Retaining the article, the passage
reads, “And as it is appointed unto <em>these</em> men once to
die.” What men? Why, the men appointed by the
Jewish law to offer sacrifices.</p>

<p>But did these men “die” in their sacrifices? Yes,
in the sense here intended. For the meaning of the
apostle we must heed the connection in which the
passage occurs. In the 16th and 17th verses, speaking
of the first testament of the Jewish covenant, the
apostle says, “For where a testament is, there must of
necessity be the <em>death</em> of the testator, for a testament
is of force when men are <em>dead</em>; otherwise it is of no
strength at all while the testator liveth.” It is so
now—no <em>will</em>, or <em>testament</em>, is in force till the testator
is <em>dead</em>. Well, Moses was the testator of the
Jewish covenant, and we know that was in full force
<em>before</em> Moses <em>died temporally</em>. What kind of a death,
then, does the apostle mean? Read on: “For when
Moses had spoken every precept to all the people”—that
is, given them the whole covenant—“according
to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with
water and scarlet wool, and myrrh, and sprinkled
both the book”—that contained the covenant—“and
all the people saying, This is the <em>blood of the testament</em>
which God hath enjoined unto you.” This sacrifice
which Moses then offered in the presence of the people,
is what the apostle calls the <em>death of the testator</em>.
He did not, of course, die temporally, but he shed
blood, offered sacrifice, and thereby sealed the covenant,
and that he terms the death of the testator.
Well, we know that the Jewish priests were set apart,
“appointed” to “die” for the people in the same<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
sense Moses died to seal the covenant. The language
with reference to Moses dying in his sacrifice, explains
what is meant by the words, “it is appointed unto
men once to die”—they died as Moses died.</p>

<p>There is reference here to the Annual Atonement
of the Jews. On that great occasion, the priest, who
was the most conspicuous personage, appeared before
the assembled congregation—that appearing was
typical of Christ’s first coming. The priest then
offered sacrifice for the sins of the Jewish nation—that
was typical of the death of Christ for the world.
The priest then disappeared, and entered into the
“Holiest of all”—that was typical of Christ entering
into paradise. In due time the priest reappeared to
the people—that was typical of Christ’s resurrection—his
“<em>second</em> appearing.” The priest at his second
appearing before the people, passed <em>judgment</em> on
them, which was, that their sins were forgiven—and
that was typical of the judgment passed on all who
trust in the risen Savior. They behold him the second
time, the risen, the glorified Savior, without sin
unto salvation. His first appearing, was when he
came in the flesh; his second appearing, when he
showed himself to the world in his spiritual and glorified
condition, and all who confide in the risen Redeemer,
as the way, the truth, and the life, are blessed
with life and salvation. To them he “appears the
second time without sin unto salvation.”</p>

<p>I also delivered several discourses in Franklin. A
Millerite, at the close of one of them, attempted to
show that the New Testament teaches, that this earth
will be destroyed. His chief reliance was on Matt.
xiii. “That passage,” said he, “speaks of the end
of the world, the harvest, and the furnace of fire. It
is not figurative language. This world is to be burned
up, and then the wicked will be cast into a lake of fire.
I do not know when all this will take place. It may
occur to-day, to-morrow, this year, next year; I know<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
not the hour, day or year, but I do know that dreadful
day of destruction will surely come, sooner, or later.”</p>

<p>I replied: The passage in Matt. xiii. affords the
gentleman’s destructive theory no aid whatever.
Learned men of all denominations tell us, that the
“end of the world,” in that passage, is the end of the
Jewish world, or age; that Christ had no reference to
the destruction of this material earth. Bishop Pearce
renders the original, “End of the age, viz: that of
the Jewish dispensation.” Dr. Hammond translates
it thus: “Conclusion of the age.” Dr. Cappe says,
the words mean, “The accomplishment of the age,
which in scripture language, uniformly relates to the
Mosaic economy.” This interpretation is fully sustained
by the New Testament. Speaking of Jesus,
the apostle Paul says: “For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world: but now
once in the <em>end of the world</em> hath he appeared to put
away sin by the sacrifice of himself.” Heb. ix. 26.
At the end of what world was Christ sacrificed? Not
the end of this earth surely, for it has survived his
death most two thousand years. According to the
gentleman’s logic, this earth was all burned up eighteen
hundred years ago, and it is all delusion that it
now exists, turns on its axis, and revolves around
yonder sun. In another place the apostle represents
the end of the world as having taken place in his day:
“And they are written for our admonition, upon
whom the ends of the world <em>are come</em>.” 1 Cor. x. 11.
If the apostle Paul was right, my friend here is miserably
deluded. The Mosaic world, or era, did end in
the apostolic age, and it is to that the New Testament
always refers when it speaks of the end of the world.</p>

<p>“The harvest,” says Jesus, “is the end of the
world.” In the Bible, the end of an era, a city, or
nation, is called its harvest. Of the destruction of
the city of Babylon, it is said, “For thus saith the
Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, The daughter of<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
Babylon is like a threshing floor, it is time to thresh
her; yet a little while, and the time of her <em>harvest</em>
shall come.... And Babylon shall become heaps, a
dwelling place for dragons; an astonishment, and a
hissing, without an inhabitant.” Jer. li. 33, 37. The
end of that city is called its harvest; so the end of
the Jewish dispensation is called its harvest.</p>

<p>The ending of the Jewish age and nation, was to
involve the ruin of multitudes of that people. Jesus
often warned them of that coming calamity; told
them, that unless they reformed they would all perish
in the approaching storm. That national desolation
is called “wrath to come,” “damnation,” “everlasting
punishment,” “furnace of fire.” “Whose fire is
in Zion, and his <em>furnace in Jerusalem</em>.” Isa. xxxi. 9.
“Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become
dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead,
in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross
of silver. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because
ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will
gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. As they
gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it,
to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in
my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the
fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst
thereof. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace,
so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and
ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my
fury upon you.” Ezek. xxii. 18-22. These passages
illustrate the meaning of “furnace of fire;” they tell
us where it is—<em>in Jerusalem</em>, not in eternity, as the
gentleman imagines. In the text the wicked Jews
are called “tares;” in the above quotations they are
termed “dross,” “dross of silver,” “lead,” “iron,”
“tin.” At the end of the Jewish state, the righteous,—the
gold and wheat of the nation,—were saved,<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
but the “tares,” the “dross” were destroyed by famine,
pestilence, and the sword. This passage, then,
certainly has no reference to the destruction of this
earth, nor to any calamity to man beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Although I find no evidence in the New Testament
of the destruction of this earth, I conclude from analogy,
that it is destined to be destroyed. Everything
that lives on the earth has its birth, maturity, and
death. This is true of every plant, animal and man.
And is it not so of the earth? The matter that
composes it may be eternal, but there was doubtless
a time in the distant past when this globe had no
existence. It is supposed that the sun once occupied
all the space in which the solar planets are now revolving,
and that those planets, with their satellites,
were then parts of the sun; but by the operation of
the laws of the Creator, governing that immense
mass of matter, portions of it became detached from
time to time, and commenced their revolution on their
axis, and around the mother globe. Those detached
portions are now the planets which belong to the solar
system. If this hypothesis be correct, the earth had a
beginning. It has passed through wonderful changes
since the day of its birth;—it has condensed, cooled,
and become fit for the growth of vegetation, and for
the habitation of animals and man. And will it not
in time lose its vitality like a decrepit old man, and
finally die, and return to the sun whence it came?
Is not this to be the fate of all the planets? And
will not the sun himself lose his life, luster and
glory, and fall into the vortex whence he came? And
will not this decomposed matter again be vitalized,
and form other globes? And is not birth, growth,
death, and decomposition going on, not only among
plants, animals, and men, but in all departments of
the material universe? And has not this process
been everlastingly going on? and will it not continue
to go on forever and ever?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>Lectured in Columbus several times; and in going
there got rather a cold bath. Came to a stream, and
being informed by a man living on its bank, that the
water was shallow, plunged into it without any hesitation,
but soon found that it was past fording and
very rapid. When I reached the opposite shore
was wet through, and the weather being very cold,
my clothes were soon frozen from head to foot. Rode
several miles in that condition, and when I reached
Columbus, which was in the night, was about as cold
as a living man can be. A preacher replied to me in
a very bitter spirit, and I took occasion to exhibit
some of the contradictions of his brethren, thus:</p>

<p>It is believed, that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the
world, but that nine tenths of the world will be forever
lost. It is believed, that Jesus tasted death for
every man, but that millions will receive no benefit
from it. It is believed, that Jesus will reign till he
has subdued all things to God, but that a majority
of mankind will be eternally unsubdued. It is believed,
that all war is unchristian, but that God will
keep up a war in hell forever. It is believed, that
capital punishment is wrong, but that God will inflict
capital punishment on all who leave this world unregenerated.
It is believed that we ought to overcome
evil with good, but that God will overcome it by
inflicting an infinite evil. It is believed, that it is the
duty of man to labor in season and out of season to
regenerate his fellow man, but that God will defeat
his labors by placing multitudes where salvation never
can be attained. It is believed, that all mankind
are brethren, but that a devil will sever that brotherhood,
and drag most of our race into the infernal
regions. It is believed, that we should love our fellow
men, but that God hates nearly all of them with
infinite hatred. It is believed, that we should imitate
God, but if we did so, provided the creeds are true,
we should be incarnate fiends. It is believed, that<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
there is only one God, but that there are three Gods.
It is believed, that man is by nature religious, but that
he is by nature totally depraved. These, and many
others, are the contradictions of what is called Orthodoxy.
Can that religion be of heaven which so
abounds with absurdities and contradictions?</p>

<p>I subsequently had a discussion in this place with
J. Wright, a Campbellite minister. Salvation, said I,
in one of my speeches, is the theme of the Bible—of
Moses, the prophet, Jesus and the apostles. But what
is salvation from? Mr. Wright says, it is from a future
endless hell, from the wrath of God, and the power
of satan. He described in burning words the horrors
of that infernal pit he wants to save us from. He
described it <em>beautifully</em>, and I noticed that some of
his brethren seemed to be delighted with the charming
picture he presented. They, doubtless, are sure
of a comfortable seat in the heavenly mansion, having
had their sins washed away in yonder stream, and
expect to have the supreme satisfaction of seeing us,
sinners, writhing in the flames of hell, the victims of
devils, and the cursed of God. They laugh now in
anticipation of this great joy to come. I envy them
not their spirit nor their hopes. But what is salvation
really from? According to the Bible, it is deliverance
from sin, error, condemnation, moral death.
“For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath
appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,
and godly, in this present world; looking for
that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ; who gave
himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works. These things speak, and
exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man
despise thee.” Titus ii. 11-15. This is a clear statement
of salvation. It is deliverance from “all iniquity”—soul-purification—and<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
is effected by the grace
or truth of God, teaching us to “deny ungodliness
and worldly lusts, and live soberly, righteously and
godly” amid the evils of this world. “These things
speak and exhort,” adds the apostle. Let this be
remembered by those who assert that a <em>present</em> salvation
is nothing, is not worth striving for, if there are
not eternal fires beyond the grave to escape. “Let
no man despise you.” Remember this, ye who
despise the message of him, who urges a present salvation,
but knows nothing of salvation from the wrath
of God, nor the torments of perdition.</p>

<p>The first time salvation is referred to in the Bible,
it relates to deliverance from iniquity. “I will put
enmity between thee and the woman, and between
thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and
thou shalt bruise his heel.” Gen. iii. 15. Here we
have the cheering assurance, that sin, symbolized by
the serpent, shall be crushed, ruined, destroyed, and
Adam’s race, consequently, delivered from its blasting,
deadly embrace—but not a word about salvation
from the future hell Mr. W. talks so eloquently about.
In Mal. iii. 2, 3, the mission of Jesus is clearly stated:
“But who may abide the day of his coming? and
who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a
refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap: and he shall sit
as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify
the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in
righteousness.” Jesus is the refiner; truth is the
fire; man, created in the image of God, is the gold;
the dross is man’s falsities. As the refiner with his
fire separates the gold from the dross, saves the one
and destroys the other, so Jesus, by the word of truth,
the gospel of our salvation, purifies our souls, separates
the earthy from the heavenly, saves the one and
destroys the other. Not a word here about deliverance
from the flames of hell, or the wrath of God.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
The earthly father of this soul-refiner was instructed
to call his name Jesus, because he would “save his
people from <em>their sins</em>;” and during his ministry on
earth, Jesus labored to that end. “Reform!” cried
he, “for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,”—not
the kingdom of hell, mark you. We should reform,
live pure and right, from <em>heavenly</em> considerations—not
from motives of an infernal nature. Nineteen
twentieths of the sermons of this age would not be
uttered if all the preachers understood that text.</p>

<p>At last, the great Reformer died, and the apostle
tells us why he died. “He died for all, that they
which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,
but him who died for them and rose again.” 2 Cor. v.
15. Jesus lived, labored, died, and rose again, that
we might “live unto him.” But we are told by the
popular creed, that it was the end and aim of Jesus,
whether living or dying, to placate the wrath of God,
and save us from a burning hell. After the Master’s
death, the apostles continued his work, and it is well
known that they labored faithfully for the present salvation
of their fellow men. The chief of them said,
“Jesus, whom we preach, warning every man, and
teaching every man, in all wisdom that we may present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus.” Col. i. 28.
He preached to make men perfect in gospel virtues—not
to redeem them from a fabled world of woe. The
apostle’s words to his pupil, Timothy, are very comprehensive:
“All scripture is given by inspiration of
God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
unto all good works.” 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17. The object
of all heavenly influences is summed up in these brief
words. To perfect our character, and cause us to
abound in good works, is the ultimate of revelation.
And how much more rational is this than the popular
notion, that it is a device to satisfy justice,<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
appease heaven’s wrath, and rescue us from hell’s
flames.</p>

<p>The discussion was to have continued four days, but
Mr. Wright’s friends closed it on the evening of the
second day. He remarked to an acquaintance of mine
soon after this, that he had rather debate with a ten-acre
field full of sectarians, than with one Universalist.</p>

<p>From Columbus I journeyed to Nashville, and
delivered three discourses. “It is too good to be
true,” said a preacher, at the close of one of the sermons.
I remarked, That is the strongest objection I
know of to this soul-cheering faith. That ourselves,
relatives, friends, all mankind, are the children of
God; that he loves us with a love many floods cannot
quench; that we have all commenced a life that is
never to end, and are destined to grow wiser, and
better, and happier, forever and ever; that we shall
again meet the loved and lost of earth, and with hand
in hand, and soul linked to soul, forever tread the
courts of the New Jerusalem—that all this is our
glorious future, I admit is hard to believe. That we
are born to so rich and glorious an inheritance is hard
to believe. There are many other blessings our heavenly
Father has provided for us, we might think the
same of under certain circumstances. Had it been
our sad lot to have been confined to this date in a
dungeon, never to have known father, mother, brother,
sister, never to have seen the face of a friend, or
to have heard the voice of love, never to have seen
the green earth, the bright sun, or blue sky, and told
to-day for the first time, that the beautiful earth and
star-spangled sky exist as we now behold them, full
of beauty for the eye, music for the ear, and love for
the heart, and that in a short time we should exchange
our dark, damp, cold cell for this glorious world,
where we should meet father, mother, brother and
sister, would we not be apt to exclaim, “It is too
good to be true!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>A man who has been an Atheist all his life, never
heard of a God, or of a future life, when told for
the first time that there is a God who governs the
world, and guides the destinies of men, and that he
is immortal and will live forever, I say when these
facts are first revealed to him, he would likely say,
“It is too good to be true.” A family that has ever
been doomed to want, sickness, disappointment, and
sorrow in every form, when informed that a kind
friend has deeded them a comfortable home, and provided
for their future support and happiness, and that
within a few days they will come in possession of all
these blessings, when informed of this they would
probably unbelievingly exclaim, “It is too good to be
true.”</p>

<p>I am not at all surprised to hear people, who all
their life-time have lived in the shade and gloom and
sorrow of a dark, repulsive, and cruel theology, say,
“Universalism is too good to be true.” There is
such a vast difference between that partial, gloomy
creed, and “the grace of God which bringeth salvation
to all men,” I do not wonder they think the latter
too good to be true. It is certainly true, that we
do not merit, by any act of ours, such blessings, and
are lost in wonder when we reflect on the immense
provisions our heavenly Father has provided for us,
and nothing short of the best of evidence makes us
rest in our glorious hope. But our hope is based on
a sure foundation—on the character, purpose, and
promises of God. On this divine trinity we found
our faith, and rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full
of glory.</p>

<p>But the doctrine of endless misery is too bad to be
true. The theory, that consigns countless millions of
mankind to the wrath of God, and the flames of hell,
is altogether too bad to be true. Before I can subscribe
to such a monstrous creed, I must believe God
to be the worst being in the universe—has no love,<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
mercy, justice, goodness, but is the very essence of
cruelty and malignity; I must believe all this ere I
can, for a moment, harbor the thought that he can be
the author of ceaseless suffering. But while I have
reason to rejoice in his goodness, I will cling to the
faith the gentleman thinks is “too good to be true.”</p>

</div>

<p>While I resided in Terre Haute, I had a debate in
Franklin, Ind., with A. L. Edmonds, on the final
destiny of man. The discussion continued four days.
Mr. Edmonds dwelt long and emphatically on the
<em>Justice</em> of God—claimed that it required the endless
wretchedness of offenders. I replied as follows, and
he dropped that subject:</p>

<p>It is said that <em>Justice</em> requires the endless suffering
of some men. That, although the goodness, mercy,
and benevolence of the Deity may be in favor of the
ultimate happiness of all men, yet his justice requires
that the wicked, who die in their sins, should be
doomed to suffer unending torment. The system of
faith into which is incorporated, as one of its parts,
the doctrine of endless punishment, suspends the
final state of men upon the <em>condition</em> they are in
when they leave this world. The question is not
how they have <em>lived</em>, but how they have <em>died</em>. This
is the point—the pivot—upon which is made to turn
the immortal destinies of men. No matter how
sinful a man may live all his life—“though as wicked
as Cain, and corrupt as Mary Magdalene with her
seven devils,” if he only <em>repent</em>, believe in the Lord
Jesus—join the church—or, in fine, “get religion”
just before he dies, all will be well with him—his
reward will be heaven. While on the other hand, no
matter how moral, upright and godly a man may live,<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
though he may have known and <em>obeyed</em> the Scriptures
from his youth up to a good old age, discharged all
his duties as a humble and faithful Christian, and
been the means of blessing hundreds of his fellow
beings, both temporally and spiritually; yet, “if he
fall from grace,” and become a sinner, even but one
day before his death, and die in that state, he, poor
old man, must go to hell!</p>

<p>This is a briefly drawn picture of the system advocated
by that class of men which <em>seem</em> to be such
sticklers for justice. If any should say such a system
is opposed to reason, the Bible, and every principle
of justice and rectitude, all I have to say is, I can’t
help it. But it is nevertheless a true and faithful
representation, so far as it goes, of the orthodox plan
of salvation and <em>damnation</em>—“nothing extenuated,
nor aught set down in malice.” Nor all its advocates
can do, will ever be sufficient, to make the system
appear anything different from this representation.
Indeed, I do not think they will <em>try</em> to do it,—they
<em>believe</em> and <em>understand</em> it, as I have described it. Let
it stand so then, as good and wholesome Orthodoxy,
while I instance a few cases for illustration, that we
may be the better enabled to see some of the monstrosities
and legitimate conclusions which must forever
follow from the above admitted premises.</p>

<p>1. Charles and Henry were brothers—twin brothers;
they lived together until they had attained their
twentieth year, when Charles died; and as he had
made no profession of religion, he was sentenced to
endless pains. Had Henry died at the same time, he
would have shared a similar doom, for he was as destitute
of religion as his brother; luckily for him, however,
he lived until his seventieth year, during the
whole of which time he was in an unconverted state,
except the last six months; for the last six months he
had lived a pious life, and consequently was admitted,
after his death, to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>“The punishment of sin,” saith my friend, “does
not take place here, but is deferred until the sinner
reaches the spiritual world.” Consequently, Henry
received no punishment in this world, for his long
career of sinfulness; and it will not be pretended that
he received it after he arrived in heaven—he was
therefore not punished at all. But how fares it with
his brother Charles? He, poor fellow, must welter
in quenchless flames, for the crimes of his brief existence.
Has God rendered to these twins according to
justice?</p>

<p>2. Two young men attempt the murder of a man
for money, and while engaged in the foul deed, one
of them is killed accidentally, by his comrade, from
the discharge of a pistol, and, of course, goes immediately
to hell—<em>to an endless hell</em>? The other succeeds
in assassinating his victim—takes his money,
which is sufficient to purchase a vessel; one is procured,
and after obtaining a crew to his mind, he
launches forth upon the “great deep,” an abandoned
pirate. Hark! do you hear those cries which float
upon the night air of the South Sea? They come
from a ship in distress. Hark again! those were the
cries of women; the young mother, and the “gay
guiltless” maiden are there. The youth and the man
of gray hairs—but the sounds of lamentation have
ceased—all is over with them. The pirate ship has
been there, and the unfortunate have all been doomed;
for alas, they had no religion. Forty years pass,
and the pirate is arraigned before a tribunal of justice—is
condemned—and confesses that, besides the
innumerable abominations he has committed in his
long life of wickedness, he has been accessory to the
murder of four hundred persons! What must be
done with him? hell is too good for him! Yes, hell
is too good for him, and, of course, he must go to
heaven. A few days are given him—he repents—and
swings from the gallows off to glory. There,<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
from his exalted station of bliss, he looks down into
the abodes of the damned, and sees scores of immortal,
wretched beings, sent there by his own hands.
Among his unfortunate victims, he sees the innocent
girl of sixteen, and the gray-headed father—and
there, too, is his first companion of crime, who fell
ere he completed his first deed of wickedness. Is
this justice? the justice of an infinitely just God?
Oh mockery!</p>

<p>3. Two men—A and B—avowed enemies, meet in
the street. Each is armed with a rifle, and each
makes ready to dispatch his enemy. A presents his
gun—it snaps; the cap was out of order. In an
instant B takes a deadly aim, his rifle discharges, and
A is a dead man. B is arrested, condemned and
dies; but, as in all such cases, he repented in time to
secure heaven, as a reward! Now if A’s gun had
not missed fire, he would have killed B, and, of
course, sent him to hell, while he might have repented
and gone to heaven. But he, poor fellow, must
go to hell, merely for the want of a good cap!</p>

<p>The most abandoned wretch that ever disgraced
humanity, can, according to this bankrupt system,
obtain an easy passport to heaven, by a few minutes
repentance just before he dies, while the moral, good,
virtuous, humane, yea, the faithful Christian—the
laborer in the cause of his Master—though he hath
worn out a long life in warning his fellows, and
inducing them to reform; though he has, according
to Orthodoxy, been the means of converting hundreds
to the belief and practice of the Christian religion,
yet, if in an evil hour, he be drawn from the path of
rectitude—become a sinner, and die suddenly, without
time to repent, he goes to an endless hell! Oh,
what justice! what consistency! Orthodoxy, thou
art <em>not</em> a jewel!</p>

<p>Orthodoxy may sing her siren song the world over,
it will not alter facts; men are punished here for their<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
sins; and the worst of it all is, that these poor
wretches, who have been deceived by the song, and
thereby led into sin, still receive their punishment
before they die, and often without knowing that it is
the reward of their own doings! They will charge
their suffering to a cruel fate, hard fortune, or some
other cause, not knowing that the hand of a just God
is upon them! But whether men believe it or not, if
they do wrong, they must and will receive their
reward; and if their experience fails to undeceive
them, it may serve to convince those who live after
them, that there “is a God who judgeth in the
earth,” and that “he cannot do iniquity.”</p>

<p>I closed my last speech on the last proposition as
follows: I am now nearly through with my part in
this debate. I have presented the gospel to you the
past four days as I truly believe it. The word <em>gospel</em>
signifies <em>good news</em>; and it is good news from God to
man, from heaven to earth. It tells us,</p>

<p>1. That God is the Father of mankind. “Have we
not <em>all</em> one Father?” Addressing Pagans in Athens,
the Gentile apostle said, “We are the offspring of
God.” Jesus instructs us to pray, “Our Father,
who art in heaven.” And he also teaches that our
heavenly Father’s love for us far exceeds the earthly
parent’s love for his offspring. And the God who
inspired him and his apostles to utter such noble sentiments,
hath said, “The mother may forget her child
but I will not forget you.” Is not this good news to
the sons and daughters of earth? We are passing
away from our earthly friends, and they are daily
leaving us; and is it not a blessed assurance that we
have an ever living and ever present Friend, who
will never leave nor forsake us? Is not this hope
good to <em>live</em> by—good to <em>die</em> by?</p>

<p>2. This same gospel also proclaims the good news
of eternal life and a blissful immortality for mankind.
We are the children of God, created in his image,<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
partake of his immortal nature; and, commencing our
existence in the bud of being, in the cradle of all life,
are destined to manifest more and more the divinity
of our nature, as the eternal ages bear us onward and
upward.</p>

<p>3. And from these cardinal truths, the New Testament
draws the logical inference, that we should love
the Lord our God with all our heart, soul and
strength, and our fellow men as ourself. God is the
Father of all, and his love extends to all, and hence
we should be loving and dutiful children. We all
belong to one family, are members of one household,
and hence we should be kind, forbearing, and forgiving
to each other. This is the gospel in letter and
spirit, in theory and practice; and nothing but this is
the gospel. It is all embraced in the word <em>love</em>—a
little word, but the length, breadth, and depth of the
universe are required to express its meaning. God is
love, his purpose is love, and love will bless his children
while immortality endures.</p>

<p>But there is not a drop of love, nor a note of glad
tidings in my opponent’s creed. It proclaims it to be
the purpose of the Almighty to consign millions of
mankind to regions of eternal sorrow, darkness and
death; and those who may escape that dreadful doom,
unless they have hearts of demons, will forever
deplore the sad fate of their earthly associates—those
they were required to love as themselves. The words
love, goodness, mercy, justice, gospel, good news, glad
tidings, should be all stricken from the Bible, if Mr.
Edmonds’ creed is true, and words that savor of fire
and brimstone, should take their places. Yea, the
sun, moon and stars, the refreshing shower, the genial
breeze, and productive earth, should all tell us of fire
and fury, instead of love, goodness and justice, if
eternal woe is to be the doom of half of mankind.
If this terrible dogma is true, it seems to me, that on
the blazing disc of the sun should be written in characters<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
as black as midnight—<em>endless woe</em>; on the
pale face of the moon, and on every twinkling star—<em>endless
woe</em>, that all might read their doom from night
to morn, from morn to night; and that every breeze
that blows, should scream in our ears so loud that the
dead might hear—<em>endless woe</em>. But thank heaven,
God is love, the gospel is good news, and these malignant
creeds are false.</p>

<p>A large number of clergymen of different orders
attended the discussion, and they held evening meetings
during the progress of the debate, but all parties
were silent on the subjects that were discussed during
the day. The disputants were kind and courteous
towards each other, and their christian spirit pervaded
the hearers of all creeds. A society was organized in
Franklin the day after the debate closed, it being
Sunday, and I preached in the place monthly for one
year. But the distance was too far for me to continue
the visits, and as no one could be obtained to take my
place, meetings were suspended. The good cause has
suffered all over the West for want of competent ministers
to supply the wants of the people. If a dozen
faithful pastors had been located in Indiana in those
days, liberal societies would now have been well
organized and permanently established all over the
state. In Franklin, Columbus, Martinsville, Gosport,
Bloomington, Greencastle, Ladoga, Crawfordsville,
Perrysville, Covington, Lafayette, Fort Wayne, Richmond,
Madison, and in many other places where we
have no organizations, flourishing and influential societies
would now be established. But ministers could
not be obtained, and hence much of the labor of the
missionary was of but little avail. Having a paper
on my hands, I was obliged to travel far and near to
sustain it, and could not devote much time at any
one place.</p>

<p>A few days after this discussion, I delivered several
sermons in Edinburg; and one of them was preached<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
in the Methodist meeting-house, and the subject, at
the request of the pastor, was “Total Depravity.”
The following is the gist of the discourse:</p>

<p>I will first show by the advocates of total depravity,
what they mean by it. The “Presbyterian Confession
of Faith” thus defines it: “The sinfulness of
estate whereinto man fell, consisteth in the guilt of
Adam’s first sin, the want of that righteousness
wherein he was created, and the corruption of his
nature, whereby he is utterly indisposed, disabled,
and made opposite to all that is spiritually good, and
wholly inclined to all evil, and that continually.”</p>

<p>The “Shorter Catechism” says: “The sinfulness
of that estate whereinto man fell, consists in the <em>guilt
of Adam’s first sin</em>, the want of original righteousness,
and the corruption of his whole nature.”</p>

<p>The “Baptist Philadelphia Confession” tells us
that “Our first parents, by this sin, fell from their
original righteousness and communion with God, and
we in them, whereby death came upon all, all becoming
dead in sin, and <em>wholly</em> defiled in all the faculties
and parts of soul and body.”</p>

<p>The “Methodist Discipline” says: “Original sin
standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians
do vainly talk) but it is the corruption of the
nature of every man, that is naturally engendered of
the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone
from original righteousness, and of his <em>own nature
inclined to evil</em>, and that continually.”</p>

<p>John Calvin, in his explanation of this doctrine,
says: “Original sin seems to be the inheritable perverseness
and corruption of our nature, poured abroad
in <em>all parts of the soul</em>, which first makes us deserving
of God’s wrath, and then also bringeth forth
those works in us, called in Scripture, the works of
the flesh. These two things are distinctly to be
noted, that is, that, being thus in all parts of our
nature perverted and corrupted, we are now, even for<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
such corruption, only holden worthy of damnation,”
etc.</p>

<p>W. W. Perkins: “In reprobate infants, the execution
of God’s decree is this: as soon as they are
born, for the guilt of original and actual sin, being
left in God’s secret judgment unto themselves, they
dying are rejected of God forever.”</p>

<p>Twiss: “Every man that is damned, is damned
for original as well as actual sins, and many thousand
infants, <em>only for original</em>.”</p>

<p>Arthur Hildersham: “There is in them (infants)
a natural proneness, disposition and inclination to
every thing that is evil; as there is in the youngest
lion, or of a bear, or of a wolf, unto cruelty, or in the
egg of a cockatrice, before it is hatched. You have
heard it evidently proved, 1. That all infants are sinners
and deserve damnation. 2. That many infants
have been vessels of wrath and fire-brands of hell.”</p>

<p>Here we have a full, clear, perfect definition of total
depravity, as held by Presbyterians, Baptists and
Methodists. It is here taught that all mankind are
by <em>nature</em>, “utterly indisposed, disabled, and made
opposite to all that is good, and wholly inclined to all
evil.” Every human being, according to this theory,
that God ever made, is “wholly inclined to <em>all evil</em>”—to
lying, cheating, stealing, murdering, etc., etc., etc.
All men, then, by nature are liars, thieves, and murderers.
This is the character of every infant when it
is born into this world. Mark the words, “There is
in infants a natural proneness, disposition and inclination
to <em>every thing that is evil</em>; as there is in the
youngest lion, or of the bear, or of the wolf, unto
cruelty, or in the egg of the cockatrice before it be
hatched,” and hence the writer adds, “1. All infants
are <em>sinners</em>, and deserve damnation. 2. That many
infants have been vessels of wrath and fire-brands of
hell.”</p>

<p>If these are correct views of human nature, for six<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
thousand years God has been creating totally depraved
beings—thieves, liars, assassins, murderers. God
is the source whence all crime flows, for he creates all
mankind <em>villains</em>; gives them all an “inclination to
all evil.” And this is not the worst of it—all deserve
everlasting damnation, because God created
them inclined to villainy of every name and grade.
The definition of depravity given above, means all
this, says all this, and to be a true Presbyterian, Baptist,
or Methodist, one must believe all this. But we
ask, who really believes a word of it? Who believes
that God is the monster these creeds represent?
Who believes that he has cursed us all with an infernal
nature, and will then damn millions forever and
ever, for being cursed with such a nature? Where is
the mother who really believes that her infant is totally
depraved, wholly “inclined to all evil,” “a fire-brand
of hell,” and “deserves damnation?” People
may subscribe to such horrid notions, preach them,
and try to defend them, but who really, heart and
soul, believes them?</p>

<p>If mankind believed that their fellow men were totally
depraved, it would destroy all confidence between
man and man. Who would trust a fellow that he
believed was by nature “wholly inclined to all evil?”
Who would employ such a physician, lawyer or clerk?
Who would trust such a banker, or commission merchant?
Who would ride on a railroad, or sail in a
vessel, that he believed was run by such wretches?
If men really believed in total depravity, they would
tremble with fear by day and by night. They would
shun each other as they shun a deadly serpent. And
if that dogma is true, there would be no virtue, truth,
purity in the world, but crime of every name and
grade would reign supreme. God would not be
known, and a devil would be universally worshiped.</p>

<p>And then what wonderful transformations, according
to the creeds, have sin and grace wrought in<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
human nature. God created man perfect in holiness
and righteousness. Human nature was then all
divine; not a spot nor a blemish in it. Every faculty
of the mind was in perfect harmony with every
other faculty. Angelic harmony reigned in the soul.
But the devil in the shape of an ugly serpent, in one
moment, ruined the best, the most perfect of God’s
works, and for the creation of which he had exercised
his greatest skill. And how easy it was effected.
One temptation was presented and the work was
done. Why, even some of those who are said to be
totally depraved, and fire-brands of hell, often resist
temptation. But mother Eve, holy and divine as she
was, succumbed at the first attack, and soon caused
her heroic husband to do likewise. This one sin
transformed Adam and Eve into devils, and caused
all their progeny down through a thousand generations
to be born devils, “vessels of wrath,” “fire-brands
of hell,” and “wholly inclined to all evil.”
Their nature became entirely changed—changed
from angelic purity to total depravity. According to
this theory, sin is far more potent than grace. One
sin committed by one person, ruined countless millions—unborn
countless millions of mankind; but
the grace of God in one soul sanctifies only that one
soul, and perhaps not that one permanently; he may
fall from grace. One sin ruined the world, but all
the power, wisdom, and grace of heaven will fail to
redeem it.</p>

<p>And then by doing so and so, it is said another
change is wrought in our nature—we are restored to
the divine likeness, to the purity and holiness Adam
enjoyed before his fall. This theory of the change of
man’s nature from purity to depravity, and from depravity
to purity, is all a fiction. If the nature of
man can change from the divine to the infernal, why
not change from a man to a <em>horse</em>? The truth is, the
nature of nothing changes from God down to the<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
worm. Every mineral, plant and animal has received
a definite nature, and never changes one iota. So
with men, their <em>nature</em> is unchangeable—soul and
body then are the same yesterday, to-day and forever.
The body may be diseased to-day, but by proper
means it may be restored to health, but its nature is
not changed. So the mind, the soul, may be disordered,
and by moral means may be restored to a
healthy condition, but its <em>nature</em> is not changed. I
am aware that several passages of Scripture are adduced
to sustain this terrible theology of innate total
depravity, and I will briefly show that they refer to
nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>1. “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin
did my mother conceive me.” Psalm. li. 5. There is
nothing here about total depravity, or about our nature
being “wholly inclined to all evil.” All inherit
tendencies to evil and to good, for mankind are imperfect.
We inherit these tendencies, not from Adam,
but from our immediate parents. Such biases are
<em>constitutional</em>, not down deep in man’s <em>nature</em>. Besides,
we are not to understand these words strictly
literal. David uttered them in a season of great
debasement. They are hyperbolical like the following:
“I am poured out like water; and all my bones
are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted
in the midst of my bowels.” “And my bones are
consumed.” “All my bones shall say, Lord, who is
like unto thee.” “I am a worm and not man.” All
this is to be understood figuratively.</p>

<p>2. “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean
thing? Not one.” Job xiv. 4. Of course, the <em>moral
character</em> of many is unclean, but what does that
prove about their <em>nature</em>? It does not intimate that
any one is <em>born</em> unclean.</p>

<p>3. “And God saw that the wickedness of man was
great in the earth, and that every imagination of the
thought of his heart was only evil continually.” Gen.<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
vi. 5. This simply means that the antediluvians
were a very wicked people; not that they were born
totally depraved, for in the 12th verse it is said, that
“all flesh <em>had corrupted his way</em>,” which it could not
have done if the Creator had made “all flesh” totally
corrupt at its birth. They were corrupt by practice,
not by nature.</p>

<p>4. “The heart of man is deceitful above all things
and desperately wicked; who can know it?” Jer.
xvii. 9. The prophet is speaking of the sin of Judah.
In the first verse he says, “The sin of Judah
is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a
diamond; it is graven upon the table of their hearts,
and upon the horns of your altars.” It was not the
sin of Adam entailed upon them, it was their own
sin, the sin of Judah. They had corrupted their
hearts, had departed from virtue’s ways, and had
become “desperately wicked.” We see nothing here
about being created totally depraved.</p>

<p>5. “They are all gone out of the way, they are
together become unprofitable; there are none that
doeth good, no, not one.” Rom. ii. 12. This passage
clearly proves that men, in the days of St. Paul, had
corrupted themselves, not that they were born totally
corrupt. They had “<em>gone</em> out of the way,” not <em>born</em>
“out of the way.” They had “<em>become</em> unprofitable,”
not <em>born</em> “unprofitable.” “Their throat is an open
sepulcher, their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness,
their feet is swift to shed blood.” Verses 12, 14,
15. Is this true of <em>infants</em>? We know it is not.
He is not speaking then of man’s condition by <em>nature</em>
but by <em>practice</em>. In the preceding chapter the apostle
says, “For when the Gentiles, which have not the
law, do by <em>nature</em> the things contained in the law,
these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves,
which shows the works of the law written <em>in their
hearts</em>.” Wicked as men were in those days, “deceitful”
as were their hearts, and “desperately wicked,”<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
the law of God was written in their hearts, and
they often did by nature, proving that their nature
was not totally depraved, “the things contained in
the law.”</p>

<p>These are the principle passages that the advocates
of total depravity cite to sustain their theory; but it is
evident they fall far short of proving any thing of the
kind. They prove, what all know to be true, that
mankind have voluntarily corrupted themselves—some
more and some less. None are perfect, none
are totally depraved, and there are all grades and
degrees, from the best man to the worst man. And
as we corrupt ourselves, we can reform ourselves.
Corruption and purity, right and wrong, evil and
good, life and death, salvation and damnation, heaven
and hell, are set before us, and we have the ability to
turn from the wrong and lay hold on the good. But
the terrible theory, that we inherit by nature, corruption,
evil, death, damnation, and hell, from Adam,
that they permeate our very nature, corrupt the very
springs of our life, constituting us “fire-brands of
hell,” and that nothing but a miracle by Almighty
God can purify us, and save us from endless burnings,
I reject as utterly false and monstrous.</p>

<p>While in Edinburg, I had some conversation with a
Presbyterian minister on religious subjects. “Why,”
said he, “you contend that Christians are rewarded
in this world for their piety and virtue. I dissent
from you. The Bible teaches me, that Christians are
crushed to earth by the cross they bear. Sinners
have no such burden to carry.”</p>

<p>I remarked: “It is true that the early Christians,
by their enthusiasm in the Christian cause, often<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
incurred the wrath of Jews and Pagans, and were
sometimes roughly handled. But this was not done
because they were good men and women, but because
they were deemed enemies of truth and righteousness—fanatics
of a dangerous creed and party. The world
did not know that it was opposing God’s noblemen,
and the highest religious and moral truths, hence
Christ, when in the agonies of death from the hands
of the unbelieving multitude, cried, ‘Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do.’ The trials,
hardships and persecutions they suffered, were incidental
to the times, and are not the legitimate results
of a holy life.</p>

<p>“And here you mistake, my friend. You suppose
that the suffering they endured are the natural
sequence of a divine life. In that you greatly err.
The advocates of any unpopular cause, let it be good
or bad, right or wrong, are sure to encounter opposition.
Especially was this so in the early days of the
Christian era. The nations of the earth, in those
times, were ignorant, intolerant, cruel, and bloody—much
more so than at the present time. The early
Christians laid hold of the religious creeds of their
day with a strong hand, tore them to atoms, and scattered
them to the four winds. This was more than
the adherents of those creeds could bear, and according
to the intolerant and cruel spirit of the times,
they pursued the enemies of their ancient faith with
fire and sword. The Christian cause was unpopular;
the Christians were an insignificant minority, and the
dominant party could not brook their zeal for what
they regarded to be a wretched delusion.</p>

<p>“Christianity is now popular among the civilized
nations of the earth, and its advocates are very differently
situated from what they were eighteen hundred
years ago. There is now no cross for them to bear,
as that term was understood in the apostolic times.
Those who come nearest to bearing it in this country,<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
are those who ‘trust in the living God as the savior
of all men.’ They are often contemptuously, cruelly
treated by the dominant parties; but thank God, if
they are inclined to revive the old persecutions, they
have not the power to do so. But the truly good in
all ages and climes, are blessed, let their outward
circumstances be what they may. Virtue is a divine
fount, whence flows the elixir of life; a tree whose
fruit heals the nations. The good man’s soul is in
harmony with truth and righteousness; he lives an
harmonious, heavenly life.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot see that there is as much difference
in the happiness of saints and sinners, as there is in
their character. The latter seem to enjoy themselves
quite as well as the former, and sometimes even better.”</p>

<p>“If the Bible is any authority, you are much mistaken.
The wicked, in that book, are said to be ‘servants,’
‘captives,’ ‘strangers,’ ‘foreigners,’ ‘wandering
prodigals;’ Christians are said to be ‘children,’
‘freemen,’ ‘fellow-citizens of the household of God,’
‘obedient children at home.’ The wicked are represented
as ‘bearing a heavy burden,’ ‘weary,’ ‘condemned,’
‘dead,’ ‘blind,’ ‘hungry,’ ‘poor,’ ‘thirsty,’
‘miserable;’ but Christians as ‘entering into rest,’
being ‘justified,’ ‘alive,’ seeing ‘the Son of righteousness,’
‘eating the bread of God,’ drinking ‘the
water of life,’ possessing ‘all things,’ and rejoicing
‘in the hope of the glory of God.’ The difference
between the two classes is clearly expressed thus:
‘There is <em>no peace</em> to the wicked’—‘<em>Great peace</em>
have they that love thy law.’</p>

<p>“Truly hath the poet said:</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">Their absence ’tis that makes a hell.</div>

<p>“The <em>outer life</em> of the good and bad, may be much
alike, but their <em>inner life</em> is vastly different. Into
one the sunshine of heaven is poured, and perpetual
summer reigns; into the other, darkness has free
access, and winter storms ever howl.”</p>

<p>Returning to Terre Haute on horseback, had some
interesting talk with my fellow travelers. The first
was a Catholic.</p>

<p>“What shall I do to be saved?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Believe in the Holy Catholic Church, and obey it
in all things.”</p>

<p>“But cannot one be saved without being a Catholic?
If one believes in God, Christ, and obeys the
divine law, cannot he be saved if he is not a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“It is possible he may be; but it is not safe to rest
one’s eternal all on such ground. The church is the
door into heaven, and I have no evidence a soul can
be saved without passing through that door. You
Protestants have great expectations of reaching heaven,
but I am fearful most of you will land where
‘the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.’”</p>

<p>The landlord of the house where I dined, was a
zealous Methodist. “What shall I do to be saved?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Believe in the Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p>“What must one believe concerning him?”</p>

<p>“That he is the second person in the adorable trinity,
and willing and able to save all who come to
him.”</p>

<p>“Cannot one be saved without believing that Jesus
is the second person in the trinity?”</p>

<p>“No. If you do not believe that, you are an infidel,
and no infidel can be saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think Catholics can be saved?”</p>

<p>“My bar-room will hold all the Catholics who will
be saved. And as for their popes, bishops and priests—I
would not give a fig for their chance. Infidelity
is bad enough, but popery is worse.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I fell in company with a Presbyterian,
and asked him, “What I should do to be
saved?”</p>

<p>“Believe in Christ.”</p>

<p>“What must I believe concerning Christ?”</p>

<p>“That he will save all he died for.”</p>

<p>“How many did he die for?”</p>

<p>“‘Are there <em>few</em> that be saved?’ ‘Strive to enter
in at the strait gate, for narrow is the gate and strait
is the way that leadeth to life and <em>few</em> there be that
find it.’ These scriptures teach that only a small part
of mankind are embraced in the covenant of grace.”</p>

<p>Soon after parting with this man, I fell in company
with a Campbellite, and I asked, “What must one
do to be saved?”</p>

<p>“Believe, be baptized, and repent.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that no one can be saved hereafter,
without faith, baptism, and repentance in this world?”</p>

<p>“I have no evidence that any can.”</p>

<p>Alas! I mentally exclaimed, how selfish, contracted
and partial are the creeds of men. The Catholic consigns
all to hell outside of his church; the Methodist
sends all to perdition who do not believe that
Jesus is the eternal God; the Presbyterian condemns
all to everlasting burnings, but the elect few; the
Campbellite has no hope for any beyond the grave,
who do not adhere to his creed, and take water. The
truth concerning salvation, is all embraced in a few
words. Jesus said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, soul, and strength, and thy
neighbor as thyself.” And one of his apostles testifies
that “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” Whoever
lives in harmony with this law is saved, let his<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
faith be what it may, and let him belong to what
party he may, or to no party. This is my faith with
reference to salvation, and does it not infinitely better
correspond with reason, and the character of God,
than the narrow contracted systems just stated by
their advocates?</p>

<p>Where I stopped over night, I heard a Mormon
deliver a discourse in defence of Mormonism. He
was an able man, well educated; and he proved as
clear as mud that the Latter-Day Saints are heaven’s
peculiar favorites. Every good Mormon, when he
dies, we were told, is transported to one of the stars,
and becomes its king, and will there reign over its
inhabitants in regal splendor forever and ever. But
anti-Mormons are consigned to the infernal regions of
Pluto, to be his subjects eternally. He also told us,
that Christ would come to this earth personally within
a few years. “I expect,” said he, “to live to witness
his second advent. He will be a Mormon, and
will empower us to destroy the Gentiles; and when
the work shall be well done, the Saints will possess
the land. I warn you to flee from the wrath to come;
accept of mercy while mercy is offered you; for when
Jesus comes, he will shut the door, and your doom
will be sealed.” He pretended to be able to work
miracles, and an old gentleman in the congregation
arose and wished him to restore his sight. “Do you
believe I can?” asked the speaker. “I will believe
you can when you do the work,” the old gentleman
replied. “But do you believe <em>now</em> that I can?” “No,
sir.” “Then I will not restore your sight.”</p>

<p>As soon as he was through the crowd cried, “Manford!
Manford! Manford!” I begged to be excused,
but the people insisted that I should pitch into Mormonism,
and I finally spent an hour in reviewing it,
and the discourse just delivered. I commenced by
remarking, that I wished to make one statement, and
to ask the speaker one question. Jesus told his disciples<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
on one occasion, that some of them would live to
see him come the second time, (Matt. xvi. 28) and he
intimated to Peter that John would be living when
he would come. (John xxi. 23). “Now you,” addressing
the preacher, “told us, that coming has not
taken place, but will take place in a short time. The
question I wish to ask is this:</p>

<p>“Is John <em>now living</em>?”</p>

<p>“He is,” replied the Mormon.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Up North, somewhere. We know he is living,
for we have a document signed by him.”</p>

<p>“Will you please show me that document.”</p>

<p>“It is not in my possession; our prophet has it.”</p>

<p>I then gave the history of the rise and progress of
Mormonism; exposed its knavery, imposture, polygamy.
The Mormons present became very angry, and
one coarse-looking fellow shook his fist in my face.
That was the first and last time I ever came in contact
with Mormons. I was probably too severe in
my remarks; but I was so disgusted at the man’s
defense of Mormonism, I gave free utterance to my
indignation.</p>

<p>Self and Mrs. Manford journeyed to Cincinnati.
We traveled in a buggy, and had a delightful jaunt,
as the weather was pleasant, the roads good, and
friends plentiful—all except the last, in striking contrast
with the other journey we took—the bridal
tour. We were absent three weeks, and I preached
nearly every day. Attended the annual meeting of
the Indiana State Convention, where we met many
friends from different portions of the state. Then
proceeded to Louisville, Ky., and attended the annual
convocation of the Kentucky State Convention.
From thence journeyed to Cincinnati, where I bought
printing materials for the <cite>Teacher</cite>, and then returned
home.</p>

<p>In 1846, I moved to Indianapolis, the capital of
Indiana. It being in the center of the state, and the
most important town therein, I deemed it a better
locality in which to publish the <cite>Teacher</cite> than Terre
Haute. It continued to be issued twice a month, Dr.
J. H. Jordan assisting; and Mrs. Manford writing
editorial, helping mail the paper, and keeping the
books. I was often absent, but the faithful doctor
and the “better half” always sent the <cite>Teacher</cite> out
regularly on its mission. Its circulation rapidly increased
after this change of base; and being in the
geographical center of the state, I could reach all
parts of it with less travel than before. I still continued
to make the saddle my home a considerable
portion of the time. Visited and preached annually,
more or less, in nearly every county in the state, and
Indiana covers a large territory, being two hundred
and fifty miles north and south, and one hundred and
fifty east and west. I also extended my peregrinations
into Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa and Michigan.
Friends of liberal principles were every where<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
multiplying, more and more interest was taken in the
good cause, and my congregations were generally
increasing. I was much encouraged, although my
labor at home and abroad was much augmented. I
often wished I could divide myself into a dozen parts,
that I might be in as many places at once.</p>

<p>There were but few of the liberal faith in Indianapolis.
About the time I moved there, B. F. Foster
commenced preaching in the city, in the old Court
House—a dirty and out of the way place. But few
attended his meetings, and after one year’s effort to
establish a congregation, he returned to Madison,
where he had previously resided. C. Cravens subsequently
made a feeble effort in the same direction,
and failed. After I left, Mr. Foster returned, and
resumed his labors, and has been successful in establishing
a good society.</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher was pastor of one of the
Presbyterian societies part of the time I resided there,
and I found him to be a liberal and jovial fellow.
Orthodoxy evidently did not trouble him then any
more than it does now, and his hearers sometimes
doubted his soundness on the “fine points.” He
would occasionally preach politics; and his sharp
thrusts would send his democratic church members
headlong out of the house. I once asked him if he
believed the Creator would eternally punish us for the
sins of this life, and he evaded giving a direct answer.</p>

<p>There was another Presbyterian preacher in Indianapolis
by the name of Gurley—a fossiled Calvinist.
He and Beecher subscribed to the same creed, but in
faith and spirit they were as far apart as the poles.
I attended his meeting once, and he thought he would
give me a hard hit. “I will relate,” said he, “how
a noted Universalist died. Ethan Allen, a revolutionary
soldier, was on his death bed. When well, he
was loud in defense of Universalism. But when he
came to die it failed him. His daughter asked him<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
just before he breathed his last, if she should cherish
the faith he had taught, or that her mother had taught
her. Believe as your mother believes, said the dying
man.” I met him the next day, and told him that
Ethan Allen was an avowed Deist. “It is the same
thing,” said he. “If you think so, you need not be
alarmed about your salvation, for all now admit that
children and idiots are safe.” This is the same Gurley
who has figured in Washington as chaplain of
Congress.</p>

<p>Soon after moving to Indianapolis, I had a discussion
in New Philadelphia, in the southern portion of
Indiana. In going there, I stopped over night in a
little village; told the landlord of the inn that I
would speak to the people if he would give notice.
As my host was a Methodist, the people inferred the
preacher was one of his brethren. “The Lord is
good unto all, and his tender mercies are over all his
works,” was my text, and I dwelt on the evidences of
God’s goodness in nature, providence, and the Bible.
I emphasized the conclusion, that as God is unchangeable
he always will, in this world and the world to
come, through all time and through all eternity, be
good unto all, and his tender mercies be ever over all
his works. As God is good to all, he blesses all <em>now</em>,
and as he always will be good to all, he <em>ever will</em> bless
all mankind. I did not say that all would be saved,
only that God would ever bless mankind. I requested
a man, who I was told was a Methodist, to close
the meeting. Before praying he remarked, “My
brethren, we have heard the gospel to-night in all its
fullness. Glory to God for such truths. They are
the bread of life. May we all feast on them and live
forever.” Another said, “I bless God for what we
have heard this evening. I have been so near heaven,
I have felt like taking the shoes from my feet.
Bless God for the word of life.” I spent the night
with a Methodist brother, and he doubtless thought I<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
was a Methodist. I practiced no deception—told the
truth clearly, boldly. No one questioned me concerning
my denominational relations, and I said nothing
on that subject. The nature of the soul is in harmony
with truth and righteousness, and when the
wisdom of heaven is unfolded, it is intuitively responded
to by men of all creeds, provided their prejudices
are not aroused by offensive names, or by unpopular
truths stated in too pointed terms. If I had told the
people I was a Universalist, the whole discourse would
have been pronounced heresy.</p>

<p>At another time, I was traveling on Sunday; coming
to a meeting-house where a congregation was
assembling, I dismounted, and took a seat with the
congregation. I knew no one, and I suppose no one
knew me. The expected preacher did not appear, and
some one arose to dismiss the assembly. I told the
people I was a minister and would deliver a discourse
if they wished me to. All seemed gratified to hear a
stranger, and I talked nearly two hours to about five
hundred people. I pursued the same course I did on
the other occasion—said nothing about other people’s
faith, called what I preached the gospel. I counted
some twenty Universalists in the congregation; at
least, I judged they were such from expressions of
their countenances when I came out were pretty clear
on Universalist ground. I spent the rest of the day
with a Presbyterian deacon, and he evidently did not
suspect I was a heretic.</p>

<p>The discussion in New Philadelphia continued two
days. My opponent was a Presbyterian minister.
We had some skirmishing before the regular battle
commenced. I delivered a discourse on Saturday
evening, and he replied. He spoke on Sunday morning,
and I replied in the afternoon. Monday and
Tuesday we met face to face, and discussed six hours
each day, when he retreating left me in possession of
the field. The discussion caused much excitement,<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
for the liberal faith was unknown to most of the people—they
had no idea that any thing could be said
in its favor. One man offered to bet his farm that I
would not be able to make a second speech. A good
society could have been established there, but no minister
could be obtained.</p>

<p>The strife between the Northern and Southern people,
which ultimated in the late rebellion, disturbed
the Universalist denomination in Indiana long before
the war commenced. The contention though was not
about slavery, but grew out of the antagonism between
people from those two sections of country.
Southern and Central Indiana was settled chiefly by
emigrants from the South, and unfortunately they
cherished prejudices against the Yankees. The Indiana
State Convention would not join the United
States Convention, because it was controlled by
Northern people. Jonathan Kidwell, who had long
been preaching in the West, resided in Indiana, was
from Kentucky. In his younger days he was a
Methodist minister; then a New Light; and finally
became a Universalist. He possessed much intellectual
power, and was well read on many subjects,
although not versed in the technicalities of knowledge.
He had long resided in Indiana, and was well
known. Some forty years ago, he had a discussion
in Indianapolis with a Methodist minister. It was
published by Mr. K., and widely circulated. He had
been editor of the <cite>Star in the West</cite>, and while I resided
in Indiana, he published a monthly magazine,
called the <cite>Philometh Encyclopediæ</cite>. He was, as
remarked, from Kentucky, pro-slavery, and had but
little love for Yankees.</p>

<p>Soon after I settled in Lafayette, he commenced a
war on Eastern preachers, calling them “silk-stocking
gentry,” sent out West to enlighten the heathen. He
complimented me by calling me a “Texan ranger,”
“a conspirator,” and a “little bishop.” Many of the<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
Universalists in the state were anxious to be connected
with the United States Convention, but Mr. Kidwell
and his friends always opposed such union.
This difference disturbed the harmony of some of our
associational and conventional meetings, and did
much mischief in the state generally. I was young,
and doubtless indiscreet in some statements I published
in the <cite>Teacher</cite>, but Mr. K. was very coarse and
abusive in his attacks. The State Convention met in
Terre Haute while I resided there, and one of Mr.
Kidwell’s friends reported that he had <em>fifty charges</em>
against me, which he intended to lay before the council.
When motion was made to adjourn, I stated
what I had heard, and demanded a presentation of
the charges threatened. This brought G. C. McCune
to his feet, and some one proposed the matter be left
to six persons, each party choosing three, and their
decision with regard to the charges be final. Both
parties consented. I selected my men, but the other
party did nothing. The year after, the Convention
met in Dublin; one of Mr. K.’s friends proposed that
I be disfellowshiped on the ground that I pretended
to have received a Letter of Fellowship in the East
when I had not, and was therefore an impostor. The
resolution was laid on the table. I then came out
with a long article in the <cite>Teacher</cite> about my troubles
in Indiana, and Mr. Kidwell made that article the
basis of charges which he presented to the Convention
the next year. It met that year in Laconia, in
the extreme southern portion of the state, and the
council was composed chiefly of delegates from some
dead societies in that locality. The result was as I
expected, and rather hoped would be—the council
voted me guilty of the charges. But that act killed
the Convention. The White River, Wabash and Upper
Wabash Associations immediately withdrew from
it, and in a few months a new Convention was organized
in my parlor in Indianapolis, and it soon joined<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
the United States Convention. The old Convention
met once or twice and then died; and about the same
time Mr. Kidwell departed this life, full of years; and
soon after, his printing office, which was then run by
E. M. Knapp, was destroyed by fire. After the new
order of things was inaugurated, peace and harmony
reigned in our councils, and the good cause was more
prosperous.</p>

<p>Liberal sentiments were making some progress in
central Illinois, and I was invited to visit that region
and hold a discussion in Springfield with a Methodist
preacher. I had never been in that portion of the
state, and it was a long journey there, for there was
no railroad connecting those two capitals in those
days. In going to Springfield, I stopped at Mt. Pulaski,
Ill., and delivered several discourses. It is on
a high mound, in the midst of vast prairies—a beautiful
situation. Here I met, for the first time, D. P.
Bunn, who resided in the place and preached there,
and in the region all around. He still lives in a
neighboring town, Decatur, and is yet faithfully discharging
his ministerial duties. He is an excellent
man, a faithful minister, and dear friend. He has
labored long and hard in the moral field, and God has
blessed him and his labors. Mr. Bunn accompanied
me to Springfield. Arriving there, I found that the
preacher who had agreed to debate with me, was not
inclined to keep his promise, and Mr. Lewis, the most
noted controversalist in that section, was chosen to
take his place. He was a Methodist minister of much
ability, and very zealous in his cause. He had
recently had a discussion with Mr. Bunn, and was
pretty well posted concerning Universalism. We
debated four days in the Representatives’ Hall of the
capitol, in the presence of vast assemblies. The discussion
produced much excitement in Springfield,
and all parties attended it. I remember seeing Mr.
Lincoln there punctually every day and every night.<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
He often nodded his head to me when I made a
strong point. Little did I think, or he think, what
was to be his future position and history.</p>

<p>In my first speech, I offered some arguments in
favor of the restitution of all things. God is love.
The Bible says, “God is love;” and all God’s works
say, he is love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Could we with ink the ocean fill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And were the skies of parchments made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Were every blade of grass a quill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And every man a scribe by trade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To write the love of God above</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Would drain the ocean dry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Nor could the scroll contain the whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Though stretch’d from sky to sky.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As love is the moral nature of God, well might the
great Gentile apostle exclaim, “I am persuaded that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other thing, shall separate
us from the love of God, which is manifested in
Christ Jesus our Lord.” Rom. viii. 38, 39. Can love
so broad, so deep, so high, so vast, so enduring, so
mighty, consign countless millions of its creations to
interminable agony? Can an ocean of love be the
source of an ocean of woe? Can the best tree bear
the worst fruit? Can the purest fountain emit the
most deadly poison? As God is love, while man
exists, he must be his friend, his benefactor, his savior.
All creeds say God is love. The old Pagans
extolled Jupiter, called him the great, the magnificent,
the glorious Jupiter, but according to their mythology,
he was a beastly monster. So modern theologies
say God is love, but they attribute to him passions
and deeds the devil might envy. God is love,
and all his purposes, and all his works perfectly harmonize
with infinite love. Universal blessedness is
the sequence of the proposition—God is love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>As God is love, he is just—just in all his purposes,
in all his works. Would it be just to force into existence
man or angel, knowing that existence would
prove an endless curse? Force man into this world,
force him through this world, force him into the
grave, force him into the spirit-world, force him into
an endless hell! That is the programme of heaven,
concerning millions of mankind, according to popular
creeds. Man is the victim of all this, if Mr. Lewis is
right. Is there any justice in this? The whole
scheme is black with crime, and reeking with vengeance,
as it culminates in the ruin of the universe.
Justice does no such work. Justice is universal right,
and it labors to bring about right; and justice will
not be satisfied till all mankind are <em>right</em>—right in
character, in condition, in life. Universal salvation is
the sequence of the proposition—God is just.</p>

<p>God is merciful. Mercy is only another manifestation
of love, and leads to the same result. The Bible
says much about the mercy of God—he is of “great
mercy,” “plenteous in mercy,” “rich in mercy.”
His mercy is said to be universal—“his tender mercies
are over all his works.” His mercy is everlasting—“the
mercy of the Lord endureth forever.”
The mercy of the Lord then is great, universal and
everlasting. It is by the mercy of God we are now
blessed; as his mercy is universal, there is no place
in the universe where his mercy will not reach us;
and as it is eternal, the time will never come when he
will not bless us. Universal blessedness then, is the
sequence of the proposition—God is merciful.</p>

<p>God is holy. Holiness is a characteristic of love.
Holiness delights in holiness, in purity, in happiness.
Good men are holy in a finite degree, and they pray,
and plan, and labor, to extend holiness. God is holy
in an infinite degree, and he purposes universal holiness.
Will he then ever place any of us where we
cannot be holy, but must lie down in depravity, in<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
corruption, in sin, forever and ever? Mr. Lewis
affirms that he will thus dispose of millions of mankind.
But that is impossible, as God is a holy being.
Here is a man; and because his children are disobedient,
he digs a dungeon, chains them in its darkness,
feeds them on bread and water; but this is not
enough; he enters that dungeon morning, noon and
evening, and beats them half to death. He continues
this barbarous treatment for days, weeks, months,
years, yea, as long as they live. Would you call that
the work of holiness? God, it is said, will deal infinitely
worse than that inhuman wretch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Far in the deep where darkness dwells,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">A land of horror and despair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Justice has built a dismal hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And laid her store of vengeance there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Into this infernal dungeon, we are told, the Creator
will thrust countless millions of mankind, swing the
door upon them, and there they must remain the helpless
victims of every vile passion, not for a day, but
to all eternity; all grace, mercy, love, withdrawn
from them; deprived of all opportunity, of all power,
all means to reform their lives, and doomed by the
holy God to be unholy through the eternal ages. Say
not this is the work of holiness; say not the holy God
will do what would be so unholy, so diabolical. As
long as God is holy he will seek the holiness of his
creatures, and as he is infinitely and everlastingly
holy, in all places and in all times he will seek man’s
holiness and happiness. Universal salvation is the
sequence of the proposition—God is holy.</p>

<p>I spoke on Sunday after the discussion closed, in
the Hall, and the spacious room was crowded to its
full capacity. Mr. Bunn afterwards labored in Springfield,
then L. C. Marvin and J. Marvin, his brother;
then A. Bosserman, and at the present time, H. R.
Nye is the pastor of the society. Our friends have<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
a good meeting-house, and liberal principles have a
strong hold in the capital of Illinois.</p>

<p>I journeyed to Alton, passing through Carlinville,
Brighton, over the prairie where Girard and Virden
now stand. There was nothing there then but wild
prairie. From Alton I proceeded to Jerseyville,
a small burg then, but now a beautiful town, and delivered
my message. Thence to Exeter, Naples, and
on to Macomb, through Rushville. In all these
places I spoke to the people. In Macomb we now
have an excellent society and a fine meeting-house.
Have often lectured there since my first visit. Had
some talk here with a Presbyterian clergyman by the
name of Chase, I think.</p>

<p>“You do not believe in hell; but that is as clearly
revealed as heaven.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I do believe in the hell the
Bible speaks of, and which wicked men experience.
But I have no faith in the hell of human creeds.
God never revealed it; it was developed from the
darkness of Paganism.”</p>

<p>“You cannot prove that.”</p>

<p>“I think I can. Nearly all learned men of all denominations
admit, that the Old Testament does not
reveal an endless hell. But from Moses to Christ the
Pagans believed in it. As heaven had not revealed
such a place, the vain imaginations of men were the
father and mother of it. Hesiod, a Greek poet, who
lived eight hundred years before Christ tells us, that
hell is so far from heaven, that it would take a mass
of iron eighteen days to fall from the latter to the
former place. The gate of hell was supposed to be
guarded by a dog having fifty heads, and to make
escape impossible, the horrid place was surrounded
by a river of fire, called Phlegethon. Virgil, another
Heathen poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Here rolls the roaring, flaming tide of hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And thundering rocks the fiery torrent swell.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>
<p>“The punishment of hell is thus described by the
same writer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Here sits in bloody robes the Fury fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">By night and day to watch the gates of hell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Here you begin terrific groans to hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And sounding lashes rise upon the ear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On every side the damned their fetters grate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And curse, ’mid clanking chains, their wretched fate.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“One sinner is bound to a wheel of fire on which
he must revolve eternally. Another is tortured with
endless hunger and thirst; he is in a lake of pure
water up to his chin, with the most delicious fruit a
few inches from him, but he cannot get a drop of
water nor a particle of food into his mouth. Danaus’
forty-nine daughters, for murdering their husbands,
were doomed to fill a leaky tub with water, drawn
from a well with a sieve. Another victim of the
gods was chained to a rock, and vultures fed on his
heart and entrails, which grew as fast as devoured.
Virgil, also thus enlightens us concerning some of the
inhabitants of hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘At hell’s dread mouth a thousand monsters wait;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1"><em>Grief</em> weeps, and <em>Vengeance</em> bellows in the gate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Base <em>Want</em>, low <em>Fear</em>, and <em>Famine’s</em> lawless rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And pale <em>Disease</em>, and slow, repining <em>Age</em>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Fierce, formidable <em>Fiends</em> the portals keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With <em>Pain</em>, <em>Toil</em>, <em>Death</em>, and Death’s half-brother, <em>Sleep</em>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">There Joys, embittered by <em>Remorse</em>, appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Daughter of <em>Guilt</em>; here storms destructive <em>War</em>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Mad <em>Discord</em> there her snaky tresses tore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Here stretched on iron beds the <em>Furies</em> roar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And close by <em>Lerna’s</em> hissing monster stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent1"><em>Briareus</em> dreadful with a hundred hands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">There stern <em>Geryon</em> raged; and all around</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Fierce <em>Harpies</em> screamed, and direful <em>Gorgons</em> frowned.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“This, sir, was the Pagan hell—believed by Pagans,
preached by Pagan priests, hundreds of years
before Jesus Christ brought a future life to light.<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
Did he teach an endless hell? If so, he taught Paganism,
not the wisdom of God. Have I not proved
that the dogma of endless punishment originated in
Heathen darkness? You admit that it is not taught
in the Old Testament; that the Jews did not believe
in it in the days of Moses or the prophets. But the
Pagans did believe in it in those days, therefore it
was not revealed from heaven, but was the product of
their own deformed minds.”</p>

<p>“Christians do not believe in the Pagan hell, but
in the Christian hell; the Pagans corrupted the
truth.”</p>

<p>“The hell of modern creeds is as horrible as the
hell of Paganism. I will give you some description
of hell by Christian authors, and you will admit that
I am correct. Rev. Isaac Ambrose, an English
divine, and a man of great talent, contends that the
Heathen did not represent hell bad enough. Alluding
to the Pagan poets just quoted, he says:</p>

<p>“‘Let poets feign of Tantalus’s tortures, Prometheus’s
vultures, Ixion’s wheels, and Charon’s rowing;
these are far short to express the pains of those
that rage in hell. There plagues have no ease, cries
have no help, time has no end, place no redemption.
It is the dark prison where the Tares [the damned]
are chained, and the wicked bound in fetters of fire
and darkness. Are there not wonderful engines,
sharp and sure instruments of revenge? fiery brimstone,
pitchy sulpher, red-hot chains, flaming whips,
scorching darkness? Will you any more? The
worm is immortal, cold intolerable, stench unendurable,
fire unquenchable, darkness palpable.... What
music affords the place but roaring and crying and
howling? Cursing is their hymns, wailing their
tunes, blasphemies their ditties, tears their notes, lamentations
their songs, screeching their strains; these
are their morning and evening songs. What mean
these chains and whips, and links and scourges? iron<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
chains, whips of steel, fiery links, knotty scourges.
Furies shake their bolts to frighten souls; the irons
strike through their ears, and the hooked engines tear
out their bowels, as if the torment of the damned
were the delight of devils.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, what a bed is this for delicate and dainty
persons; no feathers, but fire; no friends, but furies;
no ease, but fetters; no light, but smoke; no clock
nor chimes to pass away the night, but timeless eternity.
A fire, intolerable; a fire, burning, never dying!
Oh, immortal pains!... What torment, what
calamity can be compared to the shadow of this?
The wicked shall be crowded together like brick in a
fiery furnace. There is no servant to fan cold air on
their tormented parts—not so much as the chink
where the least puff of wind might enter to cool
them.’</p>

<p>“Another Orthodox poet waxes eloquent in describing
the infernal regions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Pale phantoms, hideous specters, shapes which scare</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The damned themselves, and terrify despair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Gorgons and harpies, and chimeras dire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And swarms of hissing serpents, hissing fire.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Dr. Trapp thus writes of the rivers of hell and
their fiery tide:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Fires spout in cataracts, or in furies flow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">In bubbling eddies roll the fiery tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And sulphurous surges on each other ride.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Orthodox Pollock gives this idea of hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Wide was the place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And deep as wide, and ruinous as deep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Beneath, I saw a lake of burning fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With tempest tost perpetually, and still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The waves of fiery darkness ’gainst the rocks</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of dark damnation broke, and music made</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of melancholy sort, and over head,</div><span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
    <div class="verse indent1">And all around, wind wared with wind, storm howled</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To storm, and lightning, forked lightning, crossed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of sullen wrath.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Pagan account of hell is tame compared to
the Orthodox representation of it. A Methodist
elder, a short time since, in Lafayette, Ind., told his
hearers, that hell was so hot, that if a soul was taken
out of it and put into a red hot smelting furnace, he
would freeze to death in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“I will not talk with you; for you are making
sport of a very serious subject.”</p>

<p>“I am merely relating the common view of hell, as
it is preached all over the land.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe in such a hell; neither do I
preach it. The wicked will be banished from the
presence of God, there to remain forever.”</p>

<p>“Make hell as mild as you please; put out all its
fires, throw away all its brimstone, chains and pitchforks,
and say, it is only a <em>condition</em> of sin, darkness,
mental anguish, and moral death, and it then is awful
beyond imagination. Fire, red hot wheels, boiling
lead, as means of torture, give only a faint conception
of the horrors of such a state, if it is to continue forever.
As John Wesley said, ‘What is gained if
there is no material fire in hell, when <em>all admit</em>, that
if there is no material fire there, there is <em>something
worse</em>.’”</p>

<p>From Macomb I proceeded to Burlington, Iowa,
and thence to Iowa City. Here I lectured several
times. I. M. Westfall was residing and preaching
there. It was then a small town, but now it is a large
and flourishing place. Our society owns a meeting-house,
and other valuable property.</p>

<p>Lectured in West Liberty, Tipton, Rochester, Muscatine,
Washington, Davenport, and some other places
in Iowa, and then returned to Indianapolis by the
most direct route. This was a long and laborious
journey; traveled about one thousand miles, and<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
delivered many discourses, one third of which were
in places where the people were entirely ignorant of
our faith, and in the rest they knew but very little
concerning it.</p>

<p>A short time before the new Convention was organized,
I was in North Manchester, in the northern part
of Indiana, where a youth introduced himself to me,
as William J. Chaplin, and said he had walked fifteen
miles to attend my meeting. He also stated that he
was studying theology, and intended to be a minister.
I encouraged him in his purpose, and shortly afterwards
he delivered his first sermon. He has been in
the ministry ever since, and has labored extensively,
faithfully, and effectually, in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan,
and Illinois. At the present time he resides at Dowagiac,
Mich., and devotes most of his time to the profession
of his choice.</p>

<p>About this time I had an oral discussion with Benjamin
Franklin, on three subjects—The General
Judgment—Universal Salvation—Endless Misery.
We discussed each proposition six hours. The debate
was published by both parties, and makes a book of
three hundred and fifty-nine pages. It has had a
wide circulation—three edition having been issued.
Mr. Franklin is, for he is still living, an influential
minister, editor and author, in his denomination. He
has resided in Cincinnati many years, and publishes a
large weekly religious paper in that city.</p>

<p>I also had a debate in Covington, Ind., with Mr.
French, a Baptist clergyman, which continued four
days. He was pastor of the Baptist church in that
place, and his people had immense faith in his ability
to demolish the doctrines of the Restitution. But he
labored under a great disadvantage, as he could not
extemporize; and how he wrote his speeches was a
mystery to me; he must have worked hard during
the intermissions. But his labor and wit did not save
him. His friends were disappointed with his effort,<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
and he soon after left Covington. The discussion was
held in the Baptist meeting-house, and very large
congregations listened to the arguments, <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>.</p>

<p>Soon after this, I spent four days in discussion in
Park county, Ind., with Mr. Russell, a Campbellite
minister. The neighborhood was chiefly of the
preacher’s faith; I put up with one of his brethren
while the debate was progressing. They all treated
me kindly, and we parted in friendship. Mr. R. now
resides in Iowa, and is a noted man in his denomination.</p>

<p>In the midst of this arduous labor, I wrote and
published the “One Hundred and Fifty Reasons for
Believing in the Salvation of Mankind,” about twenty
thousand copies of which has been distributed, and
I think it has done a good work.</p>

<p>Alexander Hall, of Ohio, published a book, denominated
“Universalism Against Itself,” which was
extensively circulated in the West. He has since
turned infidel, and says he wrote the book to please
the Orthodox; he was probably an infidel when he
wrote it. But his hypocrisy not then being known,
and as the book might deceive some of its readers, I
employed Dr. Jordan to answer it in the <cite>Teacher</cite>.
His review occupied a portion of the <cite>Teacher</cite> for one
year, and when it was finished, it was published in
book form, making a volume of nearly four hundred
pages. An edition of two thousand copies has been
sold. It is a strong and vigorous work, and completely
answers most of the objections urged in all
quarters against the Universalist construction of the
Bible.</p>

<p>I also published a little book of two hundred pages,
called “Truth <i lang="la">vs.</i> Error,” composed of selections
from some of our best writers. One thousand copies
of it were distributed.</p>

<p>In 1848, I commenced issuing the paper weekly,
calling it the <cite>Western Olive Branch</cite>. Soon after,<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
I unwisely moved it to Cincinnati, hoping it would
have a more general circulation if it was published
in the “Queen City” of the West. But unfortunately,
I had a partner, H. Torry, who proved to be a
dead weight on my hands, and to throw him off I
had to dispose of the paper, which I did, to J. A.
Gurley, and he connected it with the <cite>Star in the West</cite>.
After this brief partnership of a few months, resulting
thus disastrously, I returned to Indianapolis, and devoted
all my time and attention to preaching. When
this transfer was made, the circulation of the <cite>Olive
Branch</cite> was thirty-three hundred, and it had been
published nearly nine years. I was sorry to give it
up, but deemed it best to do so under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The succeeding eighteen months, I was from home
most of the time, traveling in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,
Michigan and Ohio, preaching wherever I
could have a hearing. On horseback I went from
Cincinnati to Lake Erie, and from Lake Erie to Cincinnati;
lectured in Springfield, Dayton, Columbus,
Upper Sandusky, and in many other places. I also
journeyed west as far as St. Louis, and northwest to
Iowa City.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the paper I had published for
several years, I resolved to move to St. Louis, and
establish one in that city. Accordingly, in the fall of
1850, I went to St. Louis and issued the first number
of a magazine of twenty-four pages, called the <cite>Golden
Era</cite>. I proposed publishing it monthly, at one
dollar per year. Returning to Indianapolis, I remained
there till the succeeding spring, and then left
that place for the new home on the banks of the
“Father of Waters.” We, that is, Mrs. Manford,
baby Mae, and self, with horse and carriage, proceeded
to Crawfordsville, Ind., where we attended the annual
meeting of the Upper Wabash Association. Dr.
I. D. Williamson was present, and all were much
edified with two or three excellent discourses by that
gifted clergyman. Josiah Davis was then residing
and preaching in Crawfordsville. For many years
he was a prominent minister of the United Brethren
Church; but his faith had gradually enlarged, and
for three years previous to this date, he had been an
ardent defender of the doctrines of the Restitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>Proceeded to Dayton, and there spent four days in
discussion with Mr. Russell—the same man I had
previously debated with in Park county. One of his
propositions affirmed that the “wicked will be destroyed,”
and by that he meant, <em>annihilated</em>, soul and
body. “Man,” he said, “by nature is all mortal;
and immortality is only conferred in the resurrection
on those who are regenerated in this world.” I combatted
this materialistic position thus:</p>

<p>As I read the Bible, man is a child of God, created
in his image, and is therefore a spirit, endowed with
an immortal nature. The account we have of the creation
of our race runs thus: “And God said, Let us
make man in our <em>image</em>, after our <em>likeness</em>.... So God
created man in his own <em>image</em>, in the <em>image</em> of God
created he him.” Gen. i. 26, 27. “In the day that
God created man, in the <em>likeness</em> of God made he
him.” Gen. v. 1. It is also said, “Whoso sheddeth
man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in
the <em>image</em> of God made he man.” Gen. ix. 6. In the
first book of the Bible, then, it is repeated four times,
that man was created in the image of God. Some
tell us, that image was lost in Adam, and that all his
posterity have been created in the <em>image</em> of the infernal,
but this is not the theology of the New Testament.
The apostle Paul says, “Forasmuch as man
<span class="allsmcap">IS</span> the <em>image</em> and <em>glory</em> of God.” 1 Cor. ii. 7. And
another apostle testifies to the same, “Therewith
bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
we men, which <span class="allsmcap">ARE</span> <em>made</em> in the <em>similitude</em> (or image)
of God.” James iii. 9. We may then safely affirm,
that mankind from the morning of creation to the
present time, have been created in the <em>image</em> and
<em>glory</em> of God. The fish of the sea, the fowls of the
air, the beasts of the forest, were all created—but
not in the image of God. Man only is thus distinguished.</p>

<p>The record cannot mean, that the <em>body</em> is in the<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
image of God, for God is a spirit. The body rather
is in the image of the <em>earthy</em>. “And as we have
borne the image of the <em>earthy</em>.” 1 Cor. xv. 49. But
the body is not the whole of man. There is a thinking,
reasoning, willing, propelling power within this
physical organism. It is designated by various
names in the Bible. It is called a “spirit,” the “inward
man,” “the mind.” It is doubtless this inward
man that is created in the image and glory of God.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the apostle asserts, that the
outer man, the body, is in the image of the earthy.
What does he mean? Doubtless that all the elements,
laws, forces, of the physical universe are represented,
imaged in man’s physical form; hence, wise
men in ancient and modern times have regarded man
physically as an epitome, microcosm of the outer
universe. It is then the <em>inward man</em>, the <em>spirit</em>, that
is in the image and glory of God, and consequently
all the elements of the Great Spirit are represented,
imaged in man’s spiritual organism, but in a finite
degree. God is a spirit, an immortal spirit, a being
of infinite wisdom, love and power. Man’s spirit
being in his image, and partaking of his glory, must
possess all these qualities, but in a finite degree. He
is a finite spirit, a spark from the central sun, and
partakes of the immortality, wisdom, love and power
of God.</p>

<p>The objector has said, “I know man has a body
for I see it; but I do not see the spirit you talk about,
and cannot believe it has an existence.” Do you not
see that this statement lands you in Atheism? You
believe there is a physical universe for you can see it,
or at least, part of it. But you cannot see God,
therefore, according to your reasoning, there is no
God. The apostle Paul did not reason in this unphilosophical
manner. He said, “The things that are
<em>seen</em> are <em>temporal</em>; the things that are <em>unseen</em> are
<em>eternal</em>.” As God is an invisible spirit, and the<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
inward man is in his image, of course it must be
invisible to mortal eyes.</p>

<p>The truth is, all the controlling forces of the universe
are as invisible to our material vision, as are
God and the spirits which are in his image. The
laws of gravity, of repulsion, of cohesion, are all
invisible; but they are at work in all things, from a
pebble to the sun. We cannot see them, but we
experience their effects every moment of our existence.
We cannot see electricity, but we behold it
rend the mountain oak, and melt the hardest metal;
we cannot see the atmosphere, but we behold it prostrate
the forest, and dash to atoms the work of man;
we cannot see steam, but we see its effect—it drives
the heavy train on its iron track, and propels the
giant ship across the ocean against wind and tide.
So we cannot see God, only as we behold him in all
his works.</p>

<p>We cannot see the spirit that inhabits this mortal
body, but we can behold its work. It builds up and
controls the body; gives strength to the muscles,
vigor to the hand, brightness to the eye, manliness to
the form, and genius to the brain. It constructs our
railroads, steamships, and performs all the works of
art. It employs human bone and muscle; but they
are only its servants; the indwelling spirit plans all,
executes all. What the spirit is to the body, God is
to the universe. I can as easily comprehend the
Great Spirit as I can my own spirit; I can as easily
understand how God can be present in the whole universe,<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
as I can understand how my spirit can be present
in the whole body. Take the spirit from the
body and the body dies; take God from the universe
and the universe would die—become an immense
corpse. When we know our spirit, we know God;
when we know our body, we have a philosophy of
the universe. Man, then, is godlike in his nature;
he is a spirit, has the attributes of a spirit, one of
which is <em>immortality</em>. If God is immortal, man is,
as he is in the image of God. I see no way to avoid
the conclusion, if the premise is admitted, and if we
deny that, we discard the plain teachings of the Bible.</p>

<p>What has been said concerning man being in his
nature in the divine image, is confirmed by the scriptural
testimony, that God is the <em>Father</em> of mankind.
“Have we not all one Father?” Mal. ii. 10. “For to
us there is but one God the Father.” 1 Cor. viii. 6.
“One God and Father of all.” Eph. iv. 6. Jesus
instructs us to pray, “Our Father who art in heaven.”
“O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh.”
Num. xvi. 22. This is repeated (Num. xxvii. 16)
and the apostle Paul (Heb. xii. 9) quoting it substitutes
“<em>Father</em> of spirits” for “God of spirits.” As
God is the Father of mankind, we are his children—his
offspring, hence the declaration, “Inasmuch as
we are the offspring of God.” Acts xvii. 29. Children
always partake of the nature of their parents.
As God is the “Father of spirits,” we must partake
of his spiritual nature—be in his immortal image.
This body is of mother-earth and partakes of earth’s
perishable nature; the spirit is of Father-God, and
partakes of his immortal nature. And when death
severs the connecting link between body and spirit,
the earthy returns to the earth whence it came, and
the spirit to God whence it came.</p>

<p>If these premises are correct—if the spirit of man
is in the image of God, if God is the “Father of
spirits,” it follows that man, with other rich endowments,<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
is blessed with an immortal nature, and Mr.
Russell’s position, that man is <em>all</em> mortal is incorrect.
This heaven-endowed spirit is often spoken of in the
Bible. When man was created, it is said that God
breathed into his body, and he became a “<em>living
soul</em>.” We are also told that he formeth the <em>spirit</em> of
man within him; (Zech. xii. 1) that “the body without
the <em>spirit</em> is dead.” We read of “the <em>spirits</em> in
prison;” Jesus on the cross gave up his <em>spirit</em> to God,
committed his <em>spirit</em> to God; when he appeared to
his disciples they thought they saw a <em>spirit</em>; but he
told them that a <em>spirit</em> hath neither flesh nor bones.
We are informed that the Sadducees believed in neither
angels nor <em>spirits</em>, but the Pharisees believed in
both; and when the latter heard the apostle Paul say,
that the risen Christ had appeared to him, they said,
if a <em>spirit</em> had appeared to him, they ought not to
fight against God.</p>

<p>From all this testimony, we learn that God is the
Father of mankind, and that consequently we partake
of his nature—are created in his image; and as God
is a spirit, man is a spirit; as God is immortal, man
is immortal. Man’s <em>moral character</em> may or may not
be godlike, in the divine image. The Christian only
is said to be in God’s <em>moral</em> image, to be a partaker
of the divine character; but it is the <em>nature</em> of man I
speak of at this time, not his moral character. Children
always are of the <em>nature</em> of their parents, but
their <em>moral character</em> may be very different. So
mankind, being the children of God, partake of his
divine nature, but their moral character may be ungodly.
And it is the purpose of heaven that man’s
nature shall unfold till his moral character shall be in
harmony with the divine as his nature now is. Corrupt
as may be man’s moral character, he still retains
the image and glory of God his Father in his soul, but
in various degrees of distinctness. Some, by the
great apostle, are compared to the sun, others to the<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
moon, and others still to the stars, (1 Cor. xv.) and
we are taught by the wise man that this divine glory
will grow “brighter and brighter to the perfect day.”</p>

<p>From Dayton I proceeded to Joliet, Ill., about one
hundred and forty miles distant. There had recently
been heavy rains, and the bridges on the Illinois’
rivers were nearly all swept away or much damaged,
and I had to swim my horse across the streams, or
repair the broken bridges to get my precious charge
over the turbulent waters. We had some dangerous
passes through the streams, and over the frail bridges
I had repaired. In pulling the carriage over one
bridge I came within an hair’s breadth of being pushed
into the creek, and the buggy falling on me. The
flood of this year was not quite equal to the flood of
1844, spoken of in a previous chapter, but it probably
did more damage, as the country was more improved.
When I reached Alton, some of its streets were navigable
for skiffs, and the levee at St. Louis was all submerged.
But after much hard traveling and toiling
we made Joliet; and from thence I went to St. Louis
alone, leaving Mrs. Manford to spend the summer
with her sisters in Joliet and Lockport.</p>

<p>St. Louis at that time contained eighty thousand
inhabitants, and was rapidly increasing in population,
in business, and in wealth. At the present time it
contains two hundred and ten thousand inhabitants—an
immense increase in fifteen years. It is built on
the west bank of the Mississippi river, eighteen miles
below the junction of the Missouri river with the
“Father of Waters.” The ground on which this
noble city stands, is high and rolling, its streets are
well paved, and the buildings generally are of a substantial
character, being mostly of brick. Its beautiful
site, its central location, its sixteen hundred miles
of river navigation, its railroads extended or being
extended in all directions, the vast agricultural region
of which it is the center, the immense mineral and<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
coal fields at its door—these advantages all combined
must ultimately make St. Louis one of the largest
cities of the world.</p>

<p>Several spasmodic efforts had been made to establish
a Universalist society in St. Louis. J. Libbey,
G. T. Flanders, N. M. Gaylord had preached there,
but for two or three years previous to my removal to
St. Louis all effort in that direction had been abandoned.
I lectured in the city occasionally; a society
was organized, and the next year G. S. Weaver from
Ohio became pastor of the society.</p>

<p>I had moved to St. Louis to publish a paper there,
and to travel and preach in Missouri and in the neighboring
states. An immense field was before me, a
vast amount of labor was to be performed, and I went
to work with a resolute heart. In all Southern Illinois
we had not a minister, a meeting-house, nor a
society, and, of course, our friends were few and unknown.
It was the same in Missouri, with two or
three exceptions. There were a society and preacher
just emerging from Dunkardism, in the southern part
of the state. In Troy we had a meeting-house, but
the society was dead. In the southwest part of the
state L. C. Marvin had labored some, but then he was
not residing in Missouri.</p>

<p>Leaving Mrs. Manford in charge of the paper, in
September I commenced a long and laborious journey
through Missouri, among entire strangers, expecting
to be absent three months. Crossed the Mississippi
river at Alton, four miles above where the Missouri
flows into it, to go to Cottleville, thirty miles distant,
where I had my first appointment. The rain poured
down in torrents nearly the whole day, and to add to
my troubles I got lost in the woods and swamps at
the junction of the two rivers. Regaining the road,
I traveled till dark, and finding that I could not reach
Cottleville that night, made application at a dozen
houses for lodging, but all said, “No; we are full.”<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
The night being intensely dark, the rain falling fast,
and the roads in a horrible condition and unknown to
me, I resolved to go no farther. Stopped at a house,
called the man thereof to the door, and solicited a
resting place till morning. “We have no room;
they will keep you at the next house.”</p>

<p>“What are you in this country?—heathens? At
ten or fifteen places I have been refused admittance,
each telling your story, that I could be accommodated
at the next house. Whether you take me in or not, I
shall go no farther till morning. I am wet, and cold,
and tired. It is so dark I cannot see my horse, the
road is nearly impassable, and I am a stranger in the
country; I know no one, and no one knows me. If
you will not shelter me in your house, I will sit under
this tree till morning, for I am determined to proceed
no farther to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said he, “come in, come in; we will
do the best we can for you.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Cottleville the next morning, and spoke
to the people in the evening. The next day proceeded
to Troy, and on the succeeding day delivered three
discourses. Found a respectable number of friends
there and in the vicinity, and obtained forty subscribers
for the <em>Golden Era</em>. As elsewhere remarked,
N. Wadsworth resided and preached in Troy a year
or two previous to his death, and I found many who
blessed his memory for the beautiful truths he had
taught them. Have frequently spoken in this place
since that first visit, and have some highly esteemed
friends there. Mrs. Manford often retreated to it from
the scorching sun of St. Louis.</p>

<p>Lectured in Prairieville, Louisville, and then
proceeded to Ashley, where I spoke several times.
There were four brothers by the name of Hendricks
residing near this village—all elderly men, of considerable
wealth, and had long been citizens of the
county. If the world were composed of men of the<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
sterling worth of those brothers, there should be no
need of “camp or court.” It has been my sad duty
to perform the funeral service for two of those brothers,
and for the wife of one of the survivors. “Blessed
are the dead, who die in the Lord,” and the living
who make virtue their choice. Lectured in Bowling
Green, and then in Louisiana, a beautiful town on the
Mississippi river. W. K. Kennedy, a noble man, and
ever my steadfast friend, resided in this place. He
served his country through the great rebellion, and
soon after he returned home was murdered, as is supposed,
on the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>Preached in Frankfort, and passed on to London.
As soon as it became known I was to lecture in London,
a man went post haste to Hannibal, nine miles
distant, and brought out a preacher to reply. The
moment I was through he opened on me pell mell,
without regard to sense or syntax. He evidently
believed it was thunder that killed, not lightning.
He knew nothing about the liberal faith, but thought
he had perfect knowledge of it. In noticing his
noisy harangue, I cut him right and left, and he very
considerably “subsided.” Drove to Hannibal and
lectured four times. Have often preached in that
place, and have some dear friends there. The
Browns, the Westfalls, and others, I shall esteem as
long as this heart beats. The latter have a charming
home on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi river,
embowered in trees, vines and shrubbery. All the
fruits of this latitude grow to perfection and in wonderful
profusion on their grounds. There are the
apple, pear, cherry—the best varieties—plum, peach,
grape, and berries of all kinds. It is, especially, a
delightful summer home, and Mrs. Manford frequently
fled to it from the melting sun of St. Louis.</p>

<p>A certain doctor of Hannibal published some very
coarse and false articles in a St. Louis paper about
Universalism: and I replied to him in such a manner<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
that he armed himself to shoot me when I was in the
town to fulfill an appointment, but his friends kept
him from me till I had left, and he had cooled off. I
knew nothing of the wrath of this second Achilles
till I returned to Hannibal a month after. I was not
blameless, but hardly merited being shot.</p>

<p>Lectured in Palmyra, in the Court-House full of
men—one woman only being present. A preacher
said he had one or two questions to ask.</p>

<p>“State your questions and I will try to answer
them.”</p>

<p>“Are you from the East?”</p>

<p>“I have the honor of being a son of old Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>“Are you an abolitionist?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I believe in the abolition of the devil
and all his works.”</p>

<p>“That is not what I mean. Are you a political
abolitionist?”</p>

<p>“I think every wrong in politics should be abolished,
and finally will be.”</p>

<p>“But are you for abolishing slavery in Missouri,
and the other Southern states?”</p>

<p>“I believe negro slavery to be wrong in morals and
in politics, and a curse to the white man and the black
man; but it is sustained by the laws of the land, I do
not expect to do anything unlawful against it. But
what is your object in questioning me in this public
manner?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to know your sentiments.”</p>

<p>“You have them on slavery; and now I will give
them concerning yourself. My opinion of you is,
that you are a very meddlesome and officious fellow.”</p>

<p>Although, probably, nearly all present were intensely
proslavery, for Palmyra was always strong in that
direction, they generally condemned the preacher for
his impertinence, and treated me kindly. I journeyed<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
to Tully and lectured several times. Had the following
conversation with a church member:</p>

<p>“You told us last evening, that the common theory
of a judgment day, at the end of time, was a delusion.
The Scriptures certainly teach what you were
pleased to term a delusion.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that God judges in the earth?”</p>

<p>“I do. We are in his presence every moment of
our earth-life, and he judges between the good and
the bad; the righteous are exalted, and the wicked
are debased. The Bible expressly says, ‘There is a
God who judgeth in the earth.’”</p>

<p>“Very good. You also contend, that at death we
are sent to heaven or hell. Of course this is not done
till we are judged. Civil tribunals do not hang a
man and then judge him. He is judged first. The
Divine Judge surely does not consign any to hell
without a previous judgment. I have heard ministers
of your faith at funerals tell the mourners, that the
departed have gone to the bar of God to give an
account of the deeds done in the body, and that justice
will be meted out to them. Do you believe that
we go at death to the bar of God?”</p>

<p>“That is a solemn truth, and we should have that
judgment in all our thoughts from the cradle to the
grave.”</p>

<p>“You think, I suppose, that there is to be a judgment
day at the end of the world.”</p>

<p>“I certainly do; and that is what I understood you
to deny.”</p>

<p>“According to your theology God will judge the
world three times. 1. All are judged in this world,
you assert. 2. All are judged at death. 3. All will
be judged at the end of the world. Here are three
distinct judgments. I, on the other hand, contend,
that God judges us but once, and that will continue
as long as we live. His law is stamped on the soul,
and our eternal life will only increase its impression,<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
its vividness, and by that immutable law, ingrained
in the soul, we are now judged, and ever will be
judged. If our character is in harmony with that
law, peace, bliss, heaven is our portion. If we are
disloyal to that law, we are crushed on the iron track.
And what is true now ever will be true—obedience
ever will lead to heaven, and disobedience to hell.
Instead of their being three judgments, there is only
<em>one</em>; and instead of three seasons of judgment, the
true judgment is eternal. I believe, then, in an everlasting
and universal judgment.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear a discourse on that kind of
a judgment, for it is a new idea to me.”</p>

<p>“I will deliver a discourse on that subject this
evening.”</p>

<p>Traveled to Memphis, where I spoke six times.
Delivered a discourse on the occasion of the death of
C. S. Webber, who had departed this life about one
year previous. He was from Ohio, and had labored
in Missouri two years. The good cause lost an active
and efficient laborer in his death. He was untiring
in his efforts, and it was his delight to proclaim the
unsearchable riches of heaven. At a subsequent visit
to this place, a clergyman arose in the congregation,
and propounded some thirty or forty questions, which
he had written for the occasion, and desired me to
answer them, which I did as I best could.</p>

<p>“You teach that punishment is designed to reform
the sinner. What evidence is there that you are correct?”</p>

<p>“Every sorrow, every pain, resulting from transgression,
is a voice of God telling the offender that he
has done wrong, has violated a law of the Creator,
and is on the open road to ruin, and urges him to
retrace his steps. It is a thunder-clap from the Almighty,
reverberating through the soul and body of
the transgressor, telling him of his prodigality, warning
him to flee from the wrath to come, and begging<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
him to return to truth and duty. Pain is as clearly
and as certainly the voice of God condemning vice,
and urging the offender to abandon the forbidden
path, and walk in virtue’s ways, as any word ever
spoken by a living prophet. It is God speaking
directly to man, face to face.</p>

<p>“Happiness also being the natural and sure result
of virtue, is a divine approbation of the christian life;
it is the voice of God sanctioning virtue and encouraging
the good man in righteousness. And this
approbation of virtue, and condemnation of vice, is a
revelation to man in all climes and ages. It is older
than the written Bible, and is proclaimed to all the
sons and daughters of earth, ‘Day unto day uttereth
speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language, where their voice is
not heard.’ Ps. xix. 2, 3.</p>

<p>“True, it is often drowned in the clamor of passion,
disregarded by the ignorant, and unheeded by the
thoughtless; but its testimony against all wrong, and
for all right, constantly sounding in the ears, and
being telegraphed through the soul and body of every
human being, has ever more or less curbed the passions
of the vicious, and promoted righteousness.
Happiness is man’s end and aim. For that he toils
from the cradle to the grave; and he is assured from
his own experience, which is the revelation from God
to man I have been speaking of, that vice surely
brings misery, and virtue surely brings happiness.
This fact in every one’s experience has every where
lessened vice and increased virtue, notwithstanding
passion, ignorance, false philosophy, and false religion—flesh
and the devil—have blasphemously called
it delusion, irreligion, infidelity.”</p>

<p>“You remarked in your first discourse, that there
is an analogy between the earth and man. Is not
that infidelity?”</p>

<p>“I can see no infidelity in it. It is best not to be<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
afraid of the truth. That there is a striking analogy
between man’s physical organism, and the earth of
which it is a product, is certainly correct. 1. The
rock of the earth corresponds to the bones in the human
frame. 2. The dust covering the rocky skeleton
of the earth corresponds to the flesh spread over these
bones. 3. The veins of water meandering through
the earth answer to the purple currents coursing
every part of the body. 4. The earth has internal
fires, the body has internal heat. 5. The hair of the
head, which is a vegetable, corresponds to the vegetable
growth covering the earth. 6. The earth is even
sometimes <em>sick</em>, like man, and is only relieved by
vomiting forth its feverish contents. 7. The earth is
surrounded by an atmosphere; philosophers tell us,
that every man is enveloped in an atmosphere, emenating
from his body. 8. The earth was once in a
ruder condition than it is now; man was once coarser,
more brutal than he is at the present time. 9. Man
had a beginning—‘in the beginning God made the
heavens and the earth.’ 10. This mortal body must
die, be decomposed, return to the source whence it
came; will not this earth die, be decomposed, and
return whence it came? The gentleman may call
this infidelity if he pleases. He can then finish the
chapter of folly by calling summer, winter; heat,
cold; light, darkness; truth, error; virtue, vice; and
God, devil.”</p>

<p>A Presbyterian minister replied to one of my discourses,
and after answering his objections, I proceeded
southward, and lectured in Sand Hill, Milford,
Edina and Newark. Subsequently I had an appointment
to debate four days with a man in Newark.
He was to try to sustain this proposition—“Universalism
is no better than infidelity.” But it being
impossible for me to reach there at the appointed
time, the discussion did not take place, and I never
could induce him afterwards to discuss that proposition.<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
I delivered a series of discourses in Newark
soon after this disappointment, and thus noticed the
gentleman’s proposition:</p>

<p>Mr. Matlock, I understand, when he was here to
debate with me, told you in what respect “Universalism
is no better than infidelity.” Universalism, he
made out, agrees in one or two points with infidelity,
therefore he wisely concluded that the whole system
is no better than infidelity. Let us see what Campbellism
is according to this rule. Mormonism says,
there is a God, and that he will torment millions of
mankind eternally; Campbellism says the same,
therefore Campbellism is no better than Mormonism,
and Mr. Matlock might as well go to Salt Lake and
marry a dozen of his Mormon sisters. Paganism
says, there is a burning hell for the wicked; Campbellism
says there is a burning hell for the wicked,
therefore Campbellism is no better than Paganism,
and Mr. Matlock had better sacrifice his jackass to
appease the wrath of his offended God. Catholicism
teaches, that the unbaptized will all be lost; Campbellism
teaches the same, therefore Campbellism is no
better than Catholicism, and Mr. Matlock had better
join the “mother church,” migrate to Rome, and
sanctify himself by kissing the great toe of “his holiness,”
the pope. Atheism tells us, that man is mortal
and must die; Campbellism tells the same; Campbellism,
then, is no better than Atheism.</p>

<p>But no system can be farther from infidelity than
Universalism. It is all aglow with wisdom, justice,
mercy, goodness, holiness, truth and virtue. It
teaches, that there is a God who rules in heaven and
on earth, that man is in his image, and in imitating
him we derive our chief good, and that we are destined
to approximate his adorable perfections forever
and ever. A person must have a dark and deformed
mind, who can denounce that spiritual system, and
brand it with infidelity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>At another time in going from Newark to Edina,
the rain poured down in torrents till I was about half
way through, when the wind suddenly changing to
the north, and the thermometer fell in one hour to
four degrees below zero. When I reached a haven I
was encased in a thick coat of ice, and could not get
out of the saddle without assistance. The next day I
rode thirty miles over the prairie in the face of a
northwest wind, that cut like a razor.</p>

<p>From Newark I proceeded to Shelbyville, and
spoke several times. Have often lectured there since.
Thence to Paris, Middle Grove, Columbia, in all of
which towns I had large congregations. Lectured in
Fayette, and then crossed the Missouri river, one
hundred and sixty miles from St. Louis, and preached
in Booneville, a beautiful town on the bank of “Big
Muddy,” as the Missouri is often called. This is a
mighty river. Its waters, from hundreds of fountains
in the Rocky Mountains, after dashing through deep
gorges, tumbling over vast precipices, and winding
over the immense deserts of the far west, all combine
and make one of the largest rivers in the world.
Although it is here a wide, deep and rapid stream, it
is nearly two thousand miles to where it pours its vast
contents into the salt sea. The bluffs on each side of
it, two or three hundred feet high, are about seven
miles apart, and show what this river has been doing
these many years. The clay and rock that once filled
that vast channel, seven miles wide, three hundred
feet deep, and thousands of miles long, has all been
floated away in its ceaseless and resistless tide—carried
south, and helped to redeem Louisiana and Mississippi
from ocean’s dominions.</p>

<p>About the finest country in the world is bordering
on this river in the state of Missouri. On the north
side of the river, from Iowa to where it connects with
the Mississippi river, and on the south side from
Nebraska, through Kansas to Jefferson City, Mo., the<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
land is rolling, well timbered, and the soil rich, warm
and deep. Tobacco, hemp, the cereals, the grasses,
and the fruits of the temperate climate, grow here
abundantly, and as near perfection as in any country.
Mighty cities will be built on the banks of this great
river, a dense population will throng its shores, and
civilization will here attain its highest degree of glory.</p>

<p>Journeyed to Georgetown, and lectured several
times; a man replied, I rejoined, when he said no
more. Proceeded to Calhoun and preached twice;
thence to Clinton where I spoke three times. This
was the limits of my journey south. I was in the
southwest part of Missouri. The country was thinly
settled, and the adherents of the liberal faith were
very scarce. L. C. Marvin had resided in Booneville,
and preached some in this region, but there was no
organization, and little was known of our faith. Still
my congregations were large, and the people listened
respectfully. This is an excellent field for a missionary.
It is a beautiful country, and will soon be
densely settled.</p>

<p>Traveled east to Warsaw, on the Osage river, and
delivered my message. One preacher replied, and
another asked many questions, so I had about as
much as I could attend to. The latter inquired, if we
organize churches, build meeting-houses, and ordain
ministers; and was much surprised when informed of
the number of our churches, meeting-houses and ministers.
“Do you profess to be Christians?” said he.
When I replied, yea, he added, “Well, I did not
know that.”</p>

<p>Proceeded to Jefferson City; reached there about
dark, wet and cold, for it had rained all day. Stopped
at a hotel, and inquired if there was an appointment
for me; the landlord thought there was at the
Court-house. Hastened to the place without supper,
as I had no time to attend to that, and found the
Court-house lighted, and seven or eight very respectable<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
appearing men in the large room. No more
came, and I delivered a long discourse to that small
crowd. When I was through, I mentioned the paper
I was publishing in St. Louis, and every man present
subscribed for it; and I found that they were some of
the notables of the state—the lieutenant-governor,
secretary of state, treasurer of state, auditor of state,
post-master of the town, and two lawyers.</p>

<p>The next day crossed the Missouri river to its north
side, and rode to Fulton, where I lectured, and then
proceeded to Danville. Here I meet with opposition.
When I had taken my seat in the Court-house, a man
arose in the congregation, and wished me to take for
my text, the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. I
spoke one hour on that subject, although I had rode all
day on horseback. As soon as I was through with my
discourse on that text, another wanted an explanation
of the “lake of fire” and “second death.” I accommodated
him, when a third one replied to what I had
said on both passages. I spoke another hour, and
was glad to have some rest. Rode next day to Warrenton,
thirty miles, and lectured, and by request, told
the people all I knew about the <em>devil</em>. One man in
the house seemed to think I had not done that character
justice, and so he added what I omitted with reference
to his being, history, works, character and future
prospects. He made him out to be a very powerful
being, more than a match for the Almighty, and the
author of all the sin and woe of this world. I asked
the preacher, whence the devil derived all his power
to do so much mischief, and he would not condescend
to inform me. I asked him why God did not kill the
devil if he was such an enemy to him, and he said
that was an infidel question.</p>

<p>I told the people I had not a particle of faith in
the devil of the Methodist creed, for the gentleman
was of that order. It represents him as a god—the
god of hell—and the good book does not require<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
faith in such a god. But there are devils many, that
have a real existence. Every evil thought, purpose,
passion; every error we cherish, and every wicked
act we do, is a devil, for each and all of them are enemies
to our peace, happiness and prosperity. Instead
of preaching devils, let us go to work and kill those
first in our own heart, and then aid our neighbors in
exterminating those in their hearts. This would be
dealing with devils to a good purpose.</p>

<p>After riding two more days I reached home. Had
been absent three months, delivered eighty-four discourses,
and rode about eight hundred miles. I was
well pleased with my journey, for I had made many
acquaintances, obtained a large number of subscribers
for the paper, and had accomplished, I thought, some
good. Mrs. Manford issued the October and November
numbers of the paper in my absence.</p>

<p>When the second volume of the <cite>Golden Era</cite> was
commenced, it was issued semi-monthly, and changed
to a quarto form. Its circulation rapidly increased,
but I found it rather hard to pay expenses, for St.
Louis was, and still is, a very dear place in which to
live or do business. Labor, rent, paper, commanded
high prices, and living expenses were about double
they were in Indianapolis. If the people with whom
I labored had not liberally compensated me, I could
not have kept square with the world. But I found
the Missourians to be hospitable, generous and liberal;
and I shall ever remember with gratitude the many
kindnesses I have received from their hands. I differed
from many of them concerning slavery, and they
knew it; but I am not conscious of any ill treatment
from any one on that account. We often canvassed
our differences, but in the kindest spirit on both sides,
and some of my best friends were extensive slave
holders. Many good people suppose that every slave
holder was a semi-savage; but that is a great mistake.
Some of the best men and women I was ever<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
acquainted with owned slaves. They thought slavery
was the normal condition of the black man, that God
made him for servitude to the white man. They
were educated to regard slavery in this light. Their
churches, their pastors, their school teachers, so taught
them. Slavery, then, was not wrong, but according to
the laws of God. Those who know any thing of man
well know that the most moral, most Christian people,
may cherish intellectual errors without being morally
corrupted. But slavery is now dead, and I have met
but few in Missouri who are not glad of it. Although
in their estimation, slavery was right enough, it was
unprofitable, perplexing, and the bone of contention
in the nation, and they are glad the cause of so much
strife is no more. If slavery could be restored in
Missouri to-day by the vote of the people, not one in
twenty would vote—restore it.</p>

<p>During the second year I was in St. Louis, I traveled
through Southern Missouri, Southern Illinois, and
into the south part of Indiana. This journey occupied
six weeks. Lectured in Potosi, forty miles south
of St. Louis. A clergyman replied in a very bitter
tone. I had spoken of the terrible doctrine of endless
woe, and remarked, that if it was a fact in God’s
universe, it seemed to me, that all nature would utter
cries of woe. He was offended at the remark. I
repeated, that if nine tenths of the inhabitants of
God’s universe are to howl eternally in hell, nature,
being all alive with goodness, would utter cries of
woe.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The woods would begin and tell it to the doleful winds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And doleful winds, wail to the howling hills;</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">And dismal vales, sigh to the sorrowing brooks;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But instead of this universal wailing of woe, all
nature is praising God for his goodness to the children
of men. Oh, what mockery all this would be,
if cries of agony, and wails of despair are to ascend
forever! I cannot subscribe to such a creed if I
would, and would not if I could.</p>

<p>Journeyed to Iron Mountain, and lectured once.
Here is the far famed Iron Mountain, three hundred
and twenty-eight feet high, and at its base covers an
area of five hundred acres. How far downward the
ore extends is not known, but an artisan well, one
hundred and fifty feet deep, at the base of the hill,
does not reach the limits of the iron. Its average
yield in the furnace is fifty-six per cent. Near the
surface the ore is found in pebbles or lumps, varying
in size. Below, it becomes more compact and massive.</p>

<p>Six miles south, are other deposits of iron ore, not
less rich, and, in all probability, not less extensive.
One of these is Pilot Knob, five hundred and eighty-one
feet high, with a base of three hundred and sixty
acres. Sixty per cent. of this ore is iron. One mile
from Pilot Knob is Shepherd Mountain, six hundred
and sixty feet high, and covers eight hundred acres.
This hill is penetrated with veins or dykes of iron
ore, running in different directions. The ores obtained
therefrom, are the magnetic, the specular, and a
mixture of the two. The iron yield at the furnace is
about the same as that of the other hills. There are
known to be other very valuable deposits of iron ore
in this vicinity, besides those I have named; and
likely there are others not yet discovered, in the adjacent
hills. There are also rich deposits of lead and
zinc in different localities in Southern Missouri.
Vast deposits of coal are likewise found in nearly all<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
parts of the state. The truth is, Missouri, in mineral
wealth, exceeds any other state in the Union; and
the day will surely come when her immense resources
will be developed.</p>

<p>Passed on to Millersville, where I found a large
settlement of Dunkards, who had gradually emerged
into Universalism. Soon after my visit they dissolved
their connection with that sect. They migrated
from North Carolina to that section while it belonged
to Spain. A brother by the name of Hendricks
preached with them till he died; then another
brother of the settlement, J. H. Miller, was set apart
for the ministry, and he dying a year since, —. Miller
occupies his place as teacher. They do not go abroad
for ministers, but select one of their number for the
ministerial office, and he officiates till he is called
home, and then another is chosen from the community
as his successor. This, probably, was the apostolic
method; and these excellent people, in christian virtues,
and in simplicity of manners, come as near the
original Christians as any since the first century of
the Dispensation of Grace. When the rebellion
raged in the land, to a man and woman, they were
true to their country; and being in a very exposed
position, they suffered sorely. I was in the neighborhood
several times during the war; and at one time
some rebels threatened to hang me, but they were
told that if an hair of my head was hurt, an hundred
men would instantly shoulder their muskets, and rid
the settlement of rebels forever.</p>

<p>Crossed the Mississippi river at Cape Girardeau,
one hundred and fifty miles below St. Louis, and traveled
through the southern portion of Illinois to Mt.
Vernon, Ind., on the Ohio river. Was one week
between those points, and lectured ten times. Found
but few who knew anything about the doctrines of
the Restitution, and could not learn that a discourse
had ever been before delivered in all that region in<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
their defense. Of course the prejudices of the people
were strong against me, but large numbers attended
my meetings, and I was kindly treated. Robert
Dale Owen attended one of them, and expressed himself
favorably.</p>

<p>At Elizabethtown a lawyer wished to know the
<em>philosophy</em> of Christ being the Savior of the world.
I replied thus: Jesus Christ was a man, a mere man,
nothing but a man. But what is a <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>? He is the
last, the best, the crowning work of God—the ultimate
of the universe, made in the “<em>image</em> and <em>glory</em>
of <em>God</em>.” Jesus is called in the Bible, “<em>The man</em>,
Christ Jesus.” He was <em>the man</em> of men, a <em>perfect</em>
man, fully developed in all his spiritual faculties—<em>head</em>
and <em>shoulders</em> above his brothers. Go into a
corn-field, and you will find one ear larger than any
other ear; it is only though an ear of corn. Go to
the forest, and you will find one tree larger than any
other tree; it is only though a tree. So, Christ was
a man, but he was the largest man, spiritually, that
ever lived; and that <em>fact</em> makes him our teacher, our
savior. He cannot be otherwise. We cannot teach
him; he must teach us. He is our heaven-appointed
teacher, and all he said, and all he did, is the natural
result of his spiritual pre-eminence. If this is correct
his divine mission is based in nature, is based on the
throne of God, and the gates of hell can never prevail
against it. He will continue his work till all are
taught, all are enlightened, all are saved. Greece
and Rome had their wise men; but who of the best
of them taught and lived as Jesus did? “Thou
shall,” said he, “love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, soul and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself;
bless and curse not; return good for evil; do by others
as you would have others do by you.” He not
only taught this with his lips, but his works, his character,
his soul, his life, were in perfect harmony with
such wisdom. He was godlike, thought God’s<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
thoughts, spoke God’s words, and did God’s works.
Heaven and earth will ever proclaim him—“the
Savior of mankind.”</p>

<p>Delivered several discourses in Mt. Vernon, a
pleasant town on the Ohio river, and then proceeded
to Evansville, where I also lectured. A preacher
here replied in a very abusive manner, and I paid
but little attention to him. This offended the gentleman,
and he dared me to a discussion. I refused
to have anything to do with him, as Christ had said,
“Cast not your pearl before swine.”</p>

<p>Returned to St. Louis through Booneville, Vincennes,
Lawrenceville, Olney, Salem, Carlyle, and
lectured in all those places.</p>

<p>About this time I had a discussion in Carlyle, Ill.,
with Mr. Stafford, a Presbyterian clergyman. We
were to continue the discussion four days, but he
brought it to a close at the end of the second day by
going home, as he said, to find a <em>calf</em> that had jumped
out of the lot. Whether he found the calf I cannot
say, as he did not return to report his success. He
knew nothing of the liberal faith, save what he had
learned from its enemies, and was poorly prepared to
meet the arguments in its favor.</p>

<p>He charged our people with denying the Bible,
and I replied, We do not deny the Bible. We believe
it contains a record of God’s revelation to man.
We do not say that every book, chapter, verse and
letter, from Genesis to Revelation, is inspiration.
The Bible makes no such pretention. Considerable
part of the Old and New Testaments is <em>historical</em>;
and intelligent and well informed men, can write
history correctly without inspiration, especially if they
are eye-witnesses of what they relate. Jesus Christ,
“the author and finisher of our faith,” was guided
and illuminated by the Holy Spirit. His soul was in
perfect harmony with the Great Soul of the universe,
hence he said, “I and my Father are one.” “He who<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also;” hence,
truth, from the Fountain of truth, flowed into his
soul as naturally as water flows into a sponge; hence
to do his Father’s will was his meat and drink; hence
the wisdom he uttered was the wisdom of God. He
is then the Way, the Truth, and the Life; the Teacher
and Savior of man. He is a medium through
which God speaks to, and blesses the world. Moses,
the prophets, and the apostles, were also divinely
illuminated, but not in the same <em>degree</em> Jesus was, for
he was blessed with the spirit “without measure.”
Jesus is the central figure among those anointed men.
He was “in the form of God,” and in the “express
image of his person,” by nature and by character.
He is a sun, but they are stars. You may call this
denying the Bible, if you please, but I am sure this
affirms the Bible.</p>

<p>He found fault with our name—Universalist—said
it was not scriptural. I remarked, It is admitted the
word is not in the Bible; but the idea often occurs in
that book. 1. God is the universal Father of mankind—“have
we not all one Father?” 2. He is a
universal Savior—“the Savior of all men.” 3. Jesus
is a universal Savior—“the Father sent the Son
to be the Savior of the world.” 4. God’s will is for
universal salvation—“who will have all men to be
saved.” 5. God’s grace brings universal salvation—“for
the grace of God which bringeth salvation to all
men.” 6. There will be a universal ingathering into
Christ—“gather together all things in Christ.” 7.
There is to be a universal deliverance from earthly
corruption—“the creation shall be delivered from
the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of
the children of God.” 8. Universal righteousness
will finally prevail—“by the obedience of one shall
many—the mass—be made righteous.” 9. Universal
reconciliation shall finally be effected—“God
is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.” 10.<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
There shall ultimately come a period of universal
praise to God, and confession to God’s glory. (Phil. ii;
Rev. v. 11). There will be a universal blessing of the
nations, families and kindred—“all nations, families
and kindred of the earth shall be blessed.” 12.
There is to be a universal resurrection to a heavenly
condition—“in Christ shall all be made alive.”</p>

<p>There is propriety, then, in the name. The Arminians
were once called Universalists, because they
believed in a universal atonement. We believe in a
universal atonement, and in the universal <em>efficacy</em> of
that atonement. In Europe, very learned men, men
who master all the sciences, are called Universalists.
It is an honorable name, then, a learned name,
an appropriate name for those who recognize God
as a universal Father and Savior, Christ as a universal
Redeemer, and who rejoice in the hope of the
universal destruction of sin, suffering and death, and
the universal reign of truth, virtue, life and salvation.
Universal means catholic. Our church, then,
is the true Catholic Church—all of Adam’s race will
finally be members of it, and partake of its blessings.
What is called the Catholic Church is a very partial
church. Notwithstanding the propriety of our name,
I seldom use it—it sounds a little too sectarian for my
taste. Some of my brethren are so in love with it,
they hitch it to almost every thing. That may be all
right; but I am not so deeply in love with the name
as some seem to be. I had rather be called a godly
man than a Universalist, whether I deserve the appellation
or not; and I had rather hear my church called
“the church of God,” than a Universalist church.</p>

<p>Returning to St. Louis, I lectured in Lebanon, and
a man said the sentiments I advocated lead through
Deism to Atheism. How is that? I replied. I am
with the New Testament in believing in a God for
<span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>, and a Savior for <span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>. Is there any Deism or
Atheism in that? Orthodoxy is the first step downward,<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
for it teaches a God for <span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>, but a Savior for
<span class="allsmcap">PART</span>. It makes the first departure from the gospel.
Deism is another step in the same direction, for it
says a God for <em>all</em>, but a Savior for <span class="allsmcap">NONE</span>. Atheism
is at the foot of the ladder, for it proclaims a God for
<span class="allsmcap">NONE</span>, a Savior for <span class="allsmcap">NONE</span>. There are, then, three
downward steps from Christianity or Universalism,
to Atheism—<span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>—<span class="allsmcap">PART</span>—<span class="allsmcap">NONE</span>. Orthodoxy is the
half-way house between Universalism and Infidelity.</p>

<p>Being requested to visit Florence, up the Illinois
river about one hundred miles, to hear a discourse
against Universal Salvation, and to reply if it was
proper, I arrived by packet on Sunday at eleven
o’clock, soon after the preacher had commenced his
sermon. He spoke <em>three hours</em>, and made out, he
supposed, a pretty strong case. After one hour’s
intermission, I replied to the discourse, which also
occupied three hours. The preacher, and his congregation,
heard me through; and at candle lighting of
the same day, I delivered another discourse in the
same place. In my answer to the gentleman’s discourse
I offered twenty-five objections to endless misery,
and twenty-five objections to his view of a great
judgment day; gave twenty-five proofs and arguments,
that virtue and vice are rewarded in this
world; furnished twenty-five reasons from Scripture
for believing in the final salvation of mankind.</p>

<p>A few days after this, I lectured in Naples, Ill.,
and while the congregation were singing the second
hymn, a Methodist preacher passed me a tract, which
I had seen before. Many years ago, immediately
after Hosea Ballou had delivered a discourse in some
town in Vermont, Samuel Haynes, a Congregationalist
clergyman, a gentleman of color, and pastor of a
white congregation, and of considerable education,
ability, and much wit, arose and preached a sermon
from the words of the serpent to mother Eve, “Ye
shall not surely die.” The thing was afterwards published<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
and scattered far and near. The tract the
preacher gave me was Haynes’ sermon. The serpent
is represented as a Universalist preacher, and his
words, “Ye shall not surely die,” as the essence of
Universalism. Being in a humor for it, I took parson
Haynes’ text for my text that evening, followed his
arrangement, adopted some of his language, and put
the “boot on the right foot,” I spoke as follows:</p>

<p>The Holy Scriptures are a peculiar fund of instruction.
They inform us of the origin of creation; of
the primitive state of man—his ignorance, folly and
degradation. It appears that he was placed in the
garden of Eden, with full liberty to regale himself
with all the delicious fruits that were to be found,
except what grew on one tree; if he ate of that <em>he
should</em> <span class="allsmcap">SURELY</span> <em>die on the</em> <span class="allsmcap">DAY</span> <em>of transgression</em>, (Gen.
ii. 17,) was the declaration of the Almighty. Mark
the language—he was not to be punished in the <em>next
world</em>, but in <em>this world</em>, and on the <em>day</em>, at the very
<em>time</em> he sinned. Let this be remembered, for it is
God’s truth.</p>

<p>Happy were the human pair amid this delightful
paradise, until a certain preacher endeavored to convince
them that they could sin without suffering <span class="allsmcap">IMMEDIATE</span>
punishment, without being punished on the
<span class="allsmcap">DAY</span> of transgression.</p>

<p>We may attend to the <em>character</em> of the preacher;
to the <em>doctrine</em> inculcated; to the <em>hearers</em> addressed;
to the <em>mediums</em> or <em>instruments</em> of the preaching.</p>

<p>I. As to the <span class="allsmcap">PREACHER</span>, I would observe, he is said
by the Bible, to be the lust of the flesh. “Let no one
say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, but
man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own
<em>lust</em> and enticed.” James i. 13, 14. He is also called
the <em>carnal</em> mind, and that is ever at <em>enmity</em> against
God. Read the seventh and eighth chapters of Romans
carefully. In Genesis, lust—the carnal mind—is
personified and called a serpent, and in other<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
parts of the Bible termed satan, devil and adversary,
for those terms mean a deceiver, an opposer, and that
is the character of the tempter in the human breast.
This was the tempter that led the first pair astray.</p>

<p>But to be a little more particular, let it be observed,</p>

<p>1. He is an <em>old</em> preacher. He lived about one
thousand seven hundred years before Abraham—about
two thousand four hundred and thirty years
before Moses—four thousand and four years before
Christ. It is now five thousand eight hundred and
fifty-four years since he commenced preaching. By
this time he must have acquired great skill in the art.</p>

<p>2. He is a very <em>cunning</em>, artful preacher. The serpent,
his prototype, is said to possess much wisdom
and cunning. When Elymus, the sorcerer, came to
turn away people from the faith, he is said to be <em>full
of all subtlety</em>, not only because he was an enemy of
all righteousness, but on account of his cunning and
craftiness. He manifests his cunning by preaching
to the world, that they shall not surely be punished
on the <span class="allsmcap">DAY</span> of transgression. That is a very pleasing
doctrine to the wicked. They love to be told that
the time of retribution is <span class="allsmcap">FAR IN THE DISTANCE</span>, especially
as that future punishment can all be escaped by
taking the benefit of a spiritual bankruptcy, any hour
before they die. Yes, he is a cunning preacher.</p>

<p>3. He is a very <em>laborious</em>, unwearied preacher. He
has been in the ministry almost six thousand years,
and yet his zeal is not in the least abated. The apostle
Peter compares him to a roaring lion, roaming
about seeking whom he may devour. He is far from
being circumscribed within the narrow limits of parish,
state or continental lines; but his haunts and
travels are very large and extensive. Wherever the
doctrine prevails that the wicked are not punished
<span class="allsmcap">WHEN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WHERE</span> they sin, the tempter is preaching
the same sermon he preached to mother Eve.</p>

<p>4. He is a <em>heterogeneous</em> preacher, if I may so<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
express myself. He mixes truth with error, in order
to make it go well, or to carry his point. Nobody
would bite at his hook if there was no truth on it.
He quotes fluently from the Bible, but then we must
receive his <em>interpretation</em>. If we dissent from it, all
hell is in an uproar, and we must be kicked out of his
church, and out of the world, if possible. Thousands
have been burned at the stake, because they would
not receive his interpretation of the Bible. He admits
we have reason, but then it is <em>carnal</em> and not to
be trusted; we must believe without the reason why.
He admits there is one God, but there are three persons
in the Godhead; that is, one makes three, and
three one. Christ is the Son of God, and at the same
time the Father; God is infinite in wisdom, power
and goodness, but Christ came to reconcile him to us;
God <em>wishes</em> to save all mankind but <em>cannot</em>; God <em>can</em>
save all mankind, but <em>wishes</em> to damn some to glorify
his justice; God’s <em>justice</em> requires the endless damnation
of all men, but his mercy pleads for the salvation
of all, and yet God’s attributes all harmonize. Men
are born <em>totally depraved</em>, and utterly incapable of
doing anything acceptable to God, yet it is the duty
of men to repent and turn to God; Christ has made
an atonement for the sins of the whole world, but
half of the world will be damned eternally for their
sins; God is a universal Father, God is love, and yet
will mock and laugh at the eternal groans and pains
of his children; heaven is the perfection of love, but
the saints will shout glory, when they see their fathers,
and mothers, and children, damned. Yes, he
preaches truth as well as error.</p>

<p>5. He is a very <em>presumptuous</em> preacher. Notwithstanding
God had declared on one occasion, in the
most plain and positive manner, “On the <span class="allsmcap">DAY</span> thou
eatest thereof, shall thou surely die,” yet this audacious
wretch had the impudence to confront Omnipotence,
and say, “ye shall not surely die”—on the<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">DAY</span> of transgression—and he is still repeating the old
sermon through the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>6. He is a very <em>successful</em> preacher. He draws a
great number after him. No preacher can command
hearers like him. He was successful with our first
parents—with the old world. Noah once preached
to the world that the judgments of heaven would
<em>shortly</em> come on wicked men, but the tempter repeated
his old sermon, and he made more converts than
Noah did. So it was with the cities of the plains.
Lot preached to them; the substance of which was,
“Up, get out of this <em>place</em>: for the Lord will destroy
this <em>city</em>.” Gen. xix. 14. But the old declaimer told
them, no danger, no danger; God will not punish
men in <em>this world</em>, and therefore will not destroy this
city, to which they generally gave heed, and Lot
seemed as one who mocked. They believed the
Orthodox preacher and were consumed. The father
of lies is a very successful preacher. He not only
made converts of Adam and Eve, the Antediluvians
and Sodomites, but he has proselyted most of the
world. Nearly all mankind contend that God’s judgments
are not in the earth. Dr. Franklin was about
right when he said a lie would travel all over the
country, while truth was putting on his boots.</p>

<p>II. Let us attend still more to the <span class="allsmcap">DOCTRINE</span> inculcated
by this preacher. Ye shall not surely die on
the day of transgression. Bold assertion, without a
single argument to support it. The death contained
in the threatening was, doubtless, <em>moral</em> death. They
did die to their former innocence, to the sweet communion
which they had before enjoyed with the
Father, to all the enjoyments of their beautiful garden
of fruits and flowers. The Bible says, “To be
carnally minded is <em>death</em>;” it is termed a “death in
trespasses and sins;” “The wages of sin is death;”
“You hath he quickened who <em>were dead</em>;” “We
know we have passed <em>from death</em> unto life.” This is<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
the death threatened, and the Almighty assured
Adam that he would suffer it on the <span class="allsmcap">VERY DAY</span> he
sinned. But the preacher said, No, all is false, there
is no punishment in this world, no hell, the wages of
sin is not death.</p>

<p>III. We will now take notice of the hearers
addressed by this preacher. This we have in the
context. And the serpent said unto the woman, “Ye
shall not surely die.” That Eve had not so much
experience as Adam, is evident; and so she was not
equally able to withstand temptation. This was
doubtless the reason why the tempter chose her, with
whom he might hope to be successful. Probably he
took the time when she was separated from her husband.</p>

<p>That this preacher has always had the greatest success
in the dark and ignorant parts of the earth, is
evident; his kingdom is a kingdom of darkness. He
is a great enemy of light. He will not permit his disciples
to hear a religious or philosophical discourse,
read a religious or philosophical book or paper, that
contradicts his creed—they must be like the old
knight, read only one side of the guide-board, and if
they happen to get an idea the old creed don’t sanction,
they are called heretics. They may think, but
not out of a given circle; they may reason, provided
they reason as the preacher does. And the consequence
is, that where the people think, reason and
read <em>least</em>, Orthodoxy has its truest adherents, and
where the people think, reason and read <em>most</em>, the
doctrine of Holy Writ is most prevalent, “Behold
the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much
more the wicked and sinner.” Prov. xi. 31.</p>

<p>IV. The instruments or mediums made use of by
the preacher, will now be considered. Every person,
creed and institution, that propagates the doctrine
that men shall not surely die on the <em>day of transgression</em>,
is an instrument of the father of lies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>1. Calvinism, Arminianism, Mormonism, Catholicism,
Mahommedanism and Heathenism, tell us that
this world is not one of retribution, that God does not
here reward virtue or punish vice. They unite in
teaching that this life is a state of probation, of trial,
and of course no one is punished till his probation
ends, his trial is closed. This is the deceiver’s first
sermon gone to seed.</p>

<p>2. The preachers of all these isms are also his
instruments. They are faithful to their father’s cause,
and he is much attached to them. If one opposes
their creed, some of them will at once exhibit the
spirit of the devil.</p>

<p>3. The earth is deluged with books, pamphlets and
papers, teaching that men shall not be punished on
the day of transgression.</p>


<h3>INFERENCES.</h3>

<p>1. That the devil is not dead, but still lives, and is
able to preach as well as ever, Ye shall not die on the
day of transgression.</p>

<p>2. Orthodoxy is no new fangled scheme, but can
boast of great antiquity.</p>

<p>3. See a reason why it ought to be rejected because
it is an ancient devilish doctrine.</p>

<p>4. See a reason why satan is such a mortal enemy
to the promises of the Bible, for it says, “Christ came
to destroy the devil.” Heb. ii. “Will make an end
of sin.” Dan. ix. “Behold the Lamb that taketh
away the sin of the world.” “He is the propitiation
for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of
the world.”</p>

<p>5. He hates the gospel, because it is “good news,
glad tidings”—is the “glorious gospel of the blessed
God”—“gospel of the grace of God”—“gospel of
our salvation”—“gospel of peace.”</p>

<p>6. He hates the true Christ, because he will save<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
the world from sin, error, and death. “We have
seen and do testify that this is the Christ the <span class="smcap">Savior</span>
of the <span class="allsmcap">WORLD</span>.” When the world shall be saved,
satan’s occupation will be gone.</p>

<p>7. See whence it was that satan exerted himself so
much to convince our first parents there was no punishment
in this world, because the denunciation of the
Almighty was true, and he was afraid that Adam and
Eve would continue in the belief of it, and so not
believe in endless punishment in eternity—his favorite
doctrine. If there was no proof of present punishment,
satan would not be so busy in trying to convince
men that there was none.</p>

<p>8. We infer that ministers should not be proud of
their preaching. If they preach the true gospel, they
only in substance preach Christ’s sermons. If they
preach, “Ye shall not surely die on the day of transgression,”
they only make use of the devil’s old notes
that he delivered about six thousand years ago.</p>

<p>9. It is probable that Orthodoxy will still prevail,
since this preacher is still alive, and not in the least
superannuated; and every effort against him only
enrages him more and more, and excites him to new
inventions and exertions to build up his cause.</p>

<p>To close the subject. As the author of this discourse
has spoken of the character of satan, he trusts
no one will feel himself personally injured by this
short sermon. But should any imbibe a degree of
friendship for this aged deceiver, and think that I
have not treated this Orthodox preacher with that
respect and veneration he justly deserves, let them be
so kind as to point it out, and I will most cheerfully
retract; for it has ever been a maxim with me,
“<span class="smcap">Render unto all their due</span>.”</p>

<p>This was too much for the three preachers present
so they left in a hurry, when I reached the “inferences.”
As they were marching out, I remarked,
“The wicked flee when no man pursueth.” They<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
intended an insult by throwing that tract in my face;
but the new dress in which I returned their tract kindled
their wrath; and leaving the house as they did,
was an acknowledgment, that they were defeated.
The congregation fully appreciated the “situation,”
and two or three zealous hearers clapped their hands
as the preachers were departing.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis, with whom I debated in Springfield,
sent me word, that if I should visit Jerseyville, Ill.,
his church would be at my service. Accordingly, I
made an appointment in that place, and Mr. Lewis
took a seat with me in the desk. I told him I was
perfectly willing he should make any strictures on my
discourse he might see proper. “Oh, no,” said he,
“I have invited you into my pulpit, and it would not
be proper for me to reply to your discourse.” In my
sermon, I said nothing about other creeds, but presented
my own faith in as clear a light as possible.
Mr. Lewis, at my request, made the closing prayer,
and such a prayer was never before or since heard,
I think. He took up my discourse, item by item,
systematically, and replied to it. He would first tell
the Lord what the speaker had said on a given point,
and then say, “O Lord, thou knowest that is not
true, for by the mouth of the prophet Isaiah, thou
said”—and then he would quote from the Bible.
Having argued that point to his satisfaction, he
would take up another subject; and so on till he got
through with my discourse. Having finished his
reply, I told the congregation I did not like that way
of debating; but he said, “I would as soon debate
on my <em>knees</em> as on my feet.” Before I left town, we
made arrangements for a written discussion in the
<cite>Golden Era</cite>. He was to write twelve letters; but,
having written six of them he sickened and died. I
called on him during his sickness, at Jacksonville,
and he said, “Brother Manford, if I do not go to
heaven this time, I will not work as hard as I have<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
done. I have broken myself down by hard work—by
trying to save souls.”</p>

<p>Soon after this, a Methodist clergyman of Indiana,
by the name of Mahan, proposed having a written
discussion in the <cite>Golden Era</cite>. He agreed to write
twelve letters; but six or seven exhausted his
resources. Subsequently, he tried his hand at discussion
with B. F. Foster, in the <cite>Herald</cite>, and was
handsomely defeated.</p>

<p>I made a long journey through Northern Missouri
into Iowa; thence to St. Joseph; then down to Western,
Kansas City, Independence, Lexington, Booneville,
back to St. Louis. Traveled twelve hundred
miles, all on horseback, and lectured most every day.
In most of the towns and villages on this route I had
no references, and generally wrote to the postmasters
to make appointments. The principles of the liberal
faith were entirely new to most of the people, and as
notices of my meetings were published pretty extensively,
large numbers attended, some going ten,
twenty, and thirty miles. I had much controversy in
public, and many conversations in private, concerning
the new doctrines. Found some who received them
with glad hearts, and many others who were disposed
to investigate before they condemned. Received but
little compensation for my labor and time, but obtained
many subscribers for the paper.</p>

<p>Have room for only a few of the incidents of this
journey. In Kirksville, a minister asked many questions,
and finally came to the sage conclusion, that
reason was carnal, that I was an emissary of the
devil, and that he would say no more to me; but
gave notice, that he should reply to my discourse the
next Sunday. In Greentop, found a settlement of
believers from Tennessee. They were excellent people;
often visited them in subsequent years; but the
war dispersed them, and I understand, they are scattered
over the plains of Nebraska. Kirksville, near<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
by, was one of the battle-fields of the rebellion;
rebel Porter’s forces were there routed and ruined,
and the town was much injured. Colonel Linder,
one of my friends, was an active man in the Union
cause. I traveled on what was called the “Mormon
Trace,”—a road from Nauvoo to St. Joseph, the route
the Mormons journeyed when they went from Nauvoo
to Salt Lake. It was generally through a wild
region, but the face of the country was rolling and
pleasant. About sundown one day, I rode up to a
cabin and inquired the distance to the next house.</p>

<p>“Ten miles.”</p>

<p>“Will you keep me to-night?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so; the old woman is powerful sick; I
have a heap of ailments in my cabin.”</p>

<p>“Are there any settlements up the creek?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; right smart sprinkling.”</p>

<p>There were fifteen men and women belonging to
the house, and how we were all to be disposed of that
night, was rather a puzzler to me, as there were only
two rooms in the cabin; but there was really no difficulty
on that score. The principal room answered
four valuable purposes, although it was not more than
twenty feet square—it was a kitchen, dining-room, sitting-room,
and bed-room. True, there were only two
bedsteads in it, but when bed time arrived, the floor
was covered with blankets, which afforded ample
sleeping accommodations. I was conducted into the
“parlor bed-room,” which was entirely void of all
“modern improvements.” It was made of round
logs, without any weather-boarding, plastering, ceiling,
or “chinking;” the stars could be seen through
its sides and roof, while its floor was clay, covered
about six inches deep with water. In one corner of
the pen some stakes were driven into the mud, rails
fastened to them, on which a straw bed was laid, with
a blanket or two. That was my bed; no, not <em>mine</em>,
but <em>our</em> bed; for soon a big fellow stretched himself<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
on one side of me, and he was followed by another,
who laid about six feet of flesh and bone across the
foot of the bed. I was tired, and slept first-rate all
night, and crawled out of the den in the morning
much refreshed.</p>

<p>Mine host said he had been on the frontier all his
life; did not own the land he occupied—was a squatter—and
wanted to sell his “improvements,” to go
farther west, where he could hunt bear and buffalo.
He said he was a Baptist; and when I told him of
my faith, he declared he did not want to go to heaven
if all sinners are to go there.</p>

<p>“But no sinners will go there; they will be regenerated.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me that; the reprobates will not be
regenerated; their doom is sealed. I have grace in
my soul, and know I am right.”</p>

<p>When I offered to pay him for keeping me, he
replied, “You are welcome; the fare was hard, but
if you come this way again, give me a call.”</p>

<p>A day or two after this, I rode with a negro a few
hours. He was returning from visiting his wife and
children.</p>

<p>“Why do you not live with your family?”</p>

<p>“Master won’t sell me to my wife’s master, so I
live twenty miles from her.”</p>

<p>“How often do you see her?”</p>

<p>“’Bout once a month.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever have another wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but her master died, and she was taken
south, and the children.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard since of her, and the children?”</p>

<p>“No; don’t know whar they are; may be dead.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps this wife and these children will be sold
south.”</p>

<p>“I hope I may die if they be.”</p>

<p>“Why do you not buy your freedom?”</p>

<p>“Master won’t sell me. I offered him a thousand<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
dollars, and pay him in five years, but he would not
sell me. Black men can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>“Are you treated well?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I work hard; but I would not mind
that if my family were with me.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“Virginia; left thar many years ago.”</p>

<p>“Where are your parents?”</p>

<p>“Sold south, long ago.”</p>

<p>“Where are your brothers and sisters?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know whar they are; sold to a trader.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to any church?”</p>

<p>“I belong to the Methodist church, and try to
preach.”</p>

<p>“How often do you preach?”</p>

<p>“Most every Sunday.”</p>

<p>“In how many places?”</p>

<p>“Four places.”</p>

<p>“Are you paid for preaching?”</p>

<p>“The black people pay me a little.”</p>

<p>“Do you think your white master will go to heaven?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you think slavery is right?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think it is.”</p>

<p>“How then can you think slave-holders can be
saved?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how, but I sort of think some of
them will be saved.”</p>

<p>“Would you not save all white men and all black
men if you could?”</p>

<p>“That I would.”</p>

<p>“Will not God save them all?”</p>

<p>“Why, no.”</p>

<p>“Then you are better than God, are you?”</p>

<p>“Why, master, who ever heard of God saving all
men? Now, I think of it, a man is to preach in Gentryville
to-night, who preaches that very doctrine, and
I am bound to hear him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>“What do the people say about him?”</p>

<p>“They say he is a bad man, and I believe he is, or
he would not preach such a doctrine.”</p>

<p>Here the negro left me to go to his home, and I
saw him at the window of the school-house that evening,
the picture of astonishment. Met him in the
street the next day, and he said, “Master, forgive me
for what I said yesterday.”</p>

<p>Lectured in Weston, and became acquainted with
Thomas Abbott, who was residing and preaching in
that place. He subsequently moved to St. Louis, and
for several years past has resided in Mt. Vernon, Ind.
He obeys the injunction, “<em>Go</em> and preach.” He does
go, far and near; he labors in season and out of season,
in his Master’s service. He has also become a
noted debater, and has had great success in preaching
and debating.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Missouri was Kansas Territory,
inhabited then only by Indians, but now is a
populous state, with several large cities. While I
was in Lexington on this journey, or at a subsequent
time, two negroes were hung for murdering their
owner. He had whipped them unmercifully, and
they killed him for it. They rode from the prison
to the gallows, through the principal streets of town,
in a wagon, on their coffins; white hoods were on
their heads, white frocks were thrown over their
shoulders, and large ropes were around their necks.
On the road to the gallows, the poor creatures sang
as loud as they could scream,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am bound for the kingdom;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Will you go to glory with me?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This scene, take it all in all, was the most abominable,
outrageous, and disgusting exhibition I ever witnessed.
“What do you think of <em>that</em>?” said I to a
Methodist preacher, who was looking on with a satisfied<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
air. “The majesty of the law must be sustained.”
That same fellow was a hot headed rebel when
the war broke out. His name was Kavanagh; he
formerly resided in Indiana. The town was full of
negroes; but they were silent; I saw tears in many
of their eyes.</p>

<p>After publishing the <cite>Golden Era</cite> four years, I disposed
of it to Thomas Abbott, and he soon after connected
it with the <cite>Gospel Herald</cite>, a paper published
in Indianapolis, Ind. It was being issued weekly
when it was sold; but I found, by experience, that a
weekly paper of our denomination could not be sustained
in St. Louis, the expense of publishing, and
of living being so high. While I issued the paper, I
received hardly any compensation for all my toil; and
Mrs. Manford did all her work gratuitously, and I
could not have hired a person to do what she did for
less than five hundred dollars per year.</p>

<p>The <cite>Golden Era</cite> had done a good work, and it was
like parting with a dear friend to dispose of it. Its
circulation when it went out of my hands, was thirty-five
hundred, I think. Its name had become quite
popular. Captain Bursie, who was a subscriber,
named his splendid new steamer, “<cite>The Golden Era</cite>,”
and Bridges Brothers, of St. Louis, who were also
subscribers, called a cooking stove they patented,
“<cite>The Golden Era</cite>.”</p>

<p>But I did not cease working for the good cause
when the paper was disposed of; I rather worked
harder than ever. For about two years I was absent
most of the time, preaching in Missouri, Illinois,
Iowa and Indiana.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manford was also in the field lecturing, not on
theology, but on temperance, the elevation of woman,
and general education. She delivered some excellent
lectures on those subjects in Louisiana, Hannibal, Macomb,
and other places. Let woman speak as well
as man in the lecture-room, and even in the pulpit;<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
let her speak on all subjects of human interest. As
she belongs to the human family, she is as much
interested as man in all intellectual and moral subjects.
And heaven, having gifted her with a soul,
instinct with wisdom, purity and goodness, she is
well qualified to instruct and moralize her race. I
know it is quite fashionable for men to flatter women
by calling them their “better half,” “angel,” but to
be indignant and disgusted if they aspire to a position
outside of the kitchen or nursery. Such men are
very polite to women in the street and drawing-room,
but are wrathy if they will not be their drudges or
play things. As woman is a citizen of the world as
well as man, she is entitled to all the rights and privileges
he is entitled to. The world should be open to
her intellectual and moral activities, that she may
make the best use of her time and talent. Let her
“sue and be sued,” buy and sell, vote at the polls,
and be president of these United States, if she can
get votes enough. England’s best rulers have been
queens, and why would not American women make
good presidents?</p>

<p>Antiquated, and barbarous laws and customs, that
have for ages degraded woman, are being modified
or abandoned; and the day is not far distant when
she will fill the place in society that God designed,
and humanity requires. But it must not be expected
that she will come from the wash-tub, or band-box, in
the one place a slave, and in the other a pet, prepared
fully for her new position and responsibilities. She
may long make many blunders, and for a time illy
perform her part, all of which many self-conceited,
and self-appointed, “lords of creation” will point to
and triumphantly exclaim, “Did I not tell you women
were only fit for man’s convenience?”</p>

<p>I spent three months in the southwest part of Missouri,
traveling on a circuit I established in that
region. Preached monthly in twenty-five places, and<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
rode from ten to forty miles nearly every day. Tried
to get a minister to continue the work but failed.
Good societies could have been established in Booneville,
Georgetown, Calhoun, Clinton, Oseola, Leesville,
Warsaw, Pisgah, Rocheport—places I visited.
I also spent six months traveling and preaching in
the northern part of the state. Visited twenty-two
places monthly for six months, and rode most every
day. Spent three days each month at home. I also
failed in my effort to induce a minister to locate in that
region. Clergymen of the liberal faith, residing in
the free states, were averse to moving into Missouri,
it then being a slave state. They were not only generally
opposed to slavery, regarding it as “the sum of
all villainy,” but they had no faith our cause could
be permanently established among slave-holders.
They thought that human slavery and Universalism
were eternally and universally at war with each other.</p>

<p>The winters of 1855 and ’56 were about the coldest
ever experienced in the West, and I spent both winters
in Iowa, traveling and lecturing. Often rode on
horseback all day when the thermometer was far
below zero, and delivered a long discourse at night.
The Iowa prairies are cold places in a cold day, especially
to one whose face is northward. If I had
twenty, thirty, or forty miles to ride, I always made
it a rule not to go near a fire till I had finished my
day’s travel. Some men I have rode with, must
warm themselves by a fire, whenever they get a little
cold, and swallow perhaps a dram of liquor; and I
noticed that they always suffered much more from
cold than I did. The best method for a traveler, in
an arctic day, to get up an internal heat, is, not by
whisky, not by sitting by a fire a few moments, but
by thrashing his arms, swinging his legs, or running
a short distance by the side of his horse.</p>

<p>I had a public discussion in Quincy, Ill., with a
Methodist preacher, which continued four days.<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
Large numbers attended, and much good was effected.
The day after the discussion closed, which was
Sunday, a society was organized, and soon after a
meeting-house was erected. The society prospered
for awhile, under the ministry of J. H. Hartzell, now
of Buffalo, N. Y. But he leaving, it was finally disbanded,
and the meeting-house sold, and many of its
members united themselves with the Unitarian society
of the place. Quincy is a flourishing town, on the
east bank of the Mississippi river, and is growing
rapidly in importance. The river will probably be
bridged there within a few years.</p>

<p>As I have said in a previous chapter, the <cite>Golden
Era</cite>, after it passed out of my hands, was merged
into the <cite>Gospel Herald</cite>, a paper published in Indianapolis,
Ind., and St. Louis was without a denominational
paper. This was not contemplated when I disposed
of that paper. Mr. Abbott was confident, that
with my assistance as editor, it could be sustained in
St. Louis; but experience taught him otherwise.
Although being well satisfied that a weekly paper
could not be supported in St. Louis, I was confident
that a monthly magazine could be, and hence in 1857
I commenced a monthly periodical, called <cite>Manford’s
Monthly Magazine</cite>. It contained twenty-four pages,
and the price was one dollar per year. By the close
of the first volume I had two thousand subscribers—a
pretty good beginning. Mrs. Manford was co-editor,
book-keeper, and generally assisted in mailing
the magazine.</p>

<p>I resolved to again canvass Missouri, Illinois, Iowa
and Indiana, for the benefit of the new journal; and
from 1857 to the spring of 1861, I was a large portion
of the time on the wing. The <cite>Magazine</cite> was
popular with our people, and I had no difficulty in
obtaining subscribers. The articles were chiefly doctrinal,
explanatory, and answers to the ten thousand
objections usually offered to the liberal faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>During the first year of its publication, I took a
horseback journey up the Missouri river into Kansas,
and was absent nearly all winter. At a hotel in Jefferson
City I had the following conversation with a
Deist:</p>

<p>“I believe the Old Testament is full of lies, fables
and absurdities. I would as soon believe ‘Guliver’s
Travels’ to be divine as the old Bible.”</p>

<p>“You are too fast, my friend. Without pretending
that the Old Testament is perfect, I find many excellencies
in that book. That Moses, the principal character
of it, had a deep insight into many spiritual
realities, must be conceded by every candid person.
He was born, brought up, educated, and lived till he
was eighty years old, in the midst of the grossest
superstition. The Egyptians deified the bull, the cat,
the snake, the crocodile; and many of their other
religious notions corresponded with such debased
superstitions. Moses boldly denounced the whole
of their mythological abominations; and declared
that there was only one God, and that he was a spiritual
being, and ruled in heaven and on earth. The
Egyptians believed in a formal judgment for every
soul after death; Moses taught that God judgeth in
the earth. The Egyptians maintained that there was
a hell for some and a heaven for others over the river
of death; Moses taught on all occasions that virtue is
rewarded, and vice is punished, in this world. These
four tenets are the ground-work, the basis, of Moses’
system. He introduced certain forms and ceremonies
to be practiced, till a superior <span class="smcap">Light</span> would bless the
world, and his countrymen be more advanced in civilization,
and when that Light came they were laid
aside. But his doctrines of one God, who rules the
universe, and rewards virtue and punishes vice, are
not obsolete. They are eternal truths, and you say
you believe them. You are then a disciple of Moses,
fool as you say he was. That Moses did not know<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, is readily
admitted; that all he said and did were not divine, is
also admitted; and it is also conceded that sometimes
his spirit did not seem to harmonize with the forgiving
spirit of Christ. But with all his imperfections,
he was a man among men; he was the tallest man of
his day, and his brow was bathed in the rising sun,
when the world was yet shrouded in darkness.”</p>

<p>“To that view of Moses I do not much object.
But what is called the history of the Jews, is contradictory,
and often much exaggerated.”</p>

<p>“There may be errors in the Bible history of the
Jews, but the main statements are doubtless correct.
The writers thereof make no pretention to inspiration,
that I know of. You do not reject the history of the
United States, because some of the writers thereof
contradict each other.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are the pretended prophets; do you
think they were God’s prophets?”</p>

<p>“Many events they predicted have taken place. I
believe, sir, that God has had prophets in all ages and
climes. All history, ancient and modern, is full of
the supernatural element. It is found in Grecian,
Roman, European, and American histories. It is
found in the life of Socrates, Plato, Origen, Joan of
Arc, Swedenborg, Stirling, Lavater, Oberlin, Wesley,
Luther, Murray, and in the life of innumerable other
worthies of whom the world is not worthy. We find
them among the despised and forsaken. They have
been spit upon in all the streets in the world. They
have been burned at the stake as enemies of God and
man. But they cared for none of these things; they
knew that they were walking in the light of heaven,
and all the powers of darkness could not terrify their
brave souls.</p>

<p>“We pity the Indian prince’s ignorance of the fact
that water by cold is converted into solid ice. He
was sure that such a phenomena was unnatural, and<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
‘contrary to all human experience.’ We know
though that it is done; and if we know anything of
the history of mankind, we must admit that it teaches
that supernaturalism has been prevalent at all times.
But if we pronounce this revelation of the historic
page, delusion, to be consistent we should call all history
imposition, for the supernatural is as well attested
as any statement of history. The truth is, there
is an unseen hand directing all the affairs of the universe;
and man, whether living or dying, in time or
in eternity, is constantly controlled, more or less, by
that invisible power. It is man’s natural condition
to be in alliance with the spiritual. When he is material
in all his hopes and aspirations, coarse and brutish,
he is in an unnatural condition, and the spirit of
God almost parts with him, and leaves him nearly
alone in his sins. But the pure and good are exalted
to heavenly places, commune with the spirits of the
just, and are enveloped in an halo of glory. Some
rise so high, that the hand of God is on their brow,
and then they see visions, dream dreams, heal the
sick, raise the dead, and cast out devils. Such are
God’s prophets; such were the Jewish prophets, and
the world in all ages has been blessed with the divine
utterances of such godly men and women. Although
their brows were immersed in the sun-light of heaven,
their feet were on this earth, and hence we may
expect to find their revelations sometimes tinged with
the darkness of earth.”</p>

<p>Lectured in Pisgah, and a man gave notice that he
should reply the next Sunday. I begged of him to
offer his objections while I was in town; he would not
consent to, but said, “On next Sunday I will show
that you deny the Bible, and teach a bundle of lies.”
“Name one lie I have uttered to-night.” “You can
not get me into a controversy now.” Preached in
Booneville, and then proceeded to Marshall, where I
spoke twice. Had some talk with a rum-seller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think it right to poison and impoverish
all you can?”</p>

<p>“I don’t poison or impoverish.”</p>

<p>“You don’t! Every dram you sell poisons and
impoverishes somebody. The body is the habitation
built for the soul, made in the image and glory of
God to dwell in; and it is your business from early
morn to late at night, to stand in your den and deal
damnation to God’s noble work. What abominable
business for a man to engage in! What a life to live!
What prostitution of time and opportunities! I should
think you would be fearful that the indignant earth
would open its jaws and crush you to atoms.”</p>

<p>“If your doctrine is true I am safe.”</p>

<p>“As my doctrine is true I would not stand in your
shoes for all of this world. You are a curse to yourself,
your family, and this town. The fires that are
consuming you, are scorching all with whom you
come in contact.”</p>

<p>“But you preach that all will be saved, and of
course I am included.”</p>

<p>“You will not be saved in this world, nor in the
world to come, till you repent of your sins in sackcloth
and ashes, and by the grace of God are thoroughly
regenerated. You will have to work out your
own salvation; and judging from your business, that
you occupy a very low plane in this world, morally
and spiritually, I fear you will fill a low one in the
other land, and will have to work long and hard ere
you will know much about heaven. I advise you not
to credit the slang of Orthodox preachers, that according
to Universalism all will be saved any how. We
believe in nothing of that kind. The pure and good
only are saved in this world, and the pure and good
only will be saved in the immortal world. Now, my
friend, permit me to give you one word of advice—sell
no more liquor, drink no more liquor, engage in
some honest calling, and live soberly, righteously and<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
godly the remainder of your days. By doing so, you
will live better, die happier—you will know something
of heaven in this world.”</p>

<p>Lectured in Miami, then crossed the Missouri river
to Dewitt, where I spoke several times. A society
was subsequently formed there, but the war broke it
up. Held meetings in all the towns on both sides of
the river to St. Joseph. In Kansas City lectured five
times. This is destined to be a large place. It occupies
a central position, and right in the way of trade
and travel. It is on the bank of the Missouri river,
and the Pacific railroad passes through the town.
Other roads are contemplated, some or all of which
will doubtless be built. It is also in the midst of one
of the finest agricultural regions of the world.</p>

<p>Lectured in Wyandotte, Kansas. This town joins
Kansas City, and like two drops, they will become
one—commercially, at least. Its site is magnificent,
the ground gradually ascending from the river, and
ere long it will be a rich and populous place. An
Episcopal minister asked me various questions concerning
the doctrine every where spoken against.</p>

<p>“Do your people think Jesus Christ was a human
being?”</p>

<p>“We think he was. He certainly possessed a human
constitution and organization; was subject to
hunger and thirst; was weary and cold, and was liable
to the pains and agonies ‘flesh is heir to.’ He
grew from childhood to youth, and thence to manhood.
Hence the New Testament says, ‘For we
have not a high priest which cannot be touched with
the feelings of our infirmities; but was in all points
tempted like as we are, yet without sin.’ Heb. iv. 15.
‘But made himself of no reputation, and took upon
him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness
of men: And being found in fashion as a man,
he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross.’ Phil. ii. 7, 8. ‘And the<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.’ John i.
14. He was a man, and would have died ultimately
had he lived in an age of justice and toleration.”</p>

<p>“What was the object of his death?”</p>

<p>“I will answer in the language of the Bible.
‘For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.’ 1 Peter
iii. 18. ‘For it became him, for whom are all
things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many
sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation
perfect through sufferings.’ Heb. ii. 10. ‘For if,
when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son.’ Rom. v. 10. Jesus came,
not to appease God’s wrath, or to quench the fire of
hell.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“His noble example in dying for man, has strengthened
the martyr’s faith on many a scaffold, and when
chained to many a fiery stake. And he died like
them, a martyr to truth and righteousness. He
<cite>taught</cite> love to God and man; he <cite>lived</cite> what he taught,
and he died confirming his <cite>teaching</cite> and his <cite>life</cite>.
That precept, that life, and that death, have been a
power in the world for eighteen hundred years, and
they will be a power in this world in all coming
time.”</p>

<p>“But the Bible talks about man being saved by the
<cite>blood</cite>, or <cite>death</cite> of Christ. Do you think there was no
special efficacy in his blood and death?”</p>

<p>“We say that our fathers died to save us from the
oppression of Great Britain. In the same sense
Christ died to save us from the bondage of sin, and
to cleanse us from all allegiance to despotism. Blood
from any one’s veins can only cleanse in a figurative<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
sense. It is the truth which Jesus taught that cleanseth
the soul; and as his blood was shed in attestation
of the truth, the Bible refers figuratively to that blood
as the efficient cause of our deliverance and salvation.
In this sense he ‘bore our sins and our iniquities,’
was ‘wounded for our transgressions,’ and ‘by his
stripes we are healed.’”</p>

<p>“There are men in high places in our church who
entertain similar views, but in my estimation, they
are erroneous. I accept the creed of the church, that
Jesus was God, and of all the sequences of that proposition.”</p>

<p>Proceeded to Leavenworth, where I delivered four
discourses. This was then a small town, but is now
a large city, and destined to be a very important one.
We ought to have a minister at work there. A large
congregation could soon be gathered. There are
many influential families who would give such a man
their hearty support. While here I heard the following
conversation in an adjoining room at an hotel:</p>

<p>“Did you attend the Universalist meeting last
night?”</p>

<p>“No; I have no faith in the creed of that church.
What was the preacher’s text?”</p>

<p>“‘I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,’ were
the words. I must confess, I was much interested.
It was the first Universalist sermon I ever heard, and
I am inclined to think it was the first <cite>gospel</cite> sermon I
ever heard. I have, all my life, heard about the
abominations of Universalism, and I supposed it was
a mass of corruption. But if that man last night
preached Universalism, I don’t know but I must be a
Universalist.”</p>

<p>“What did he say that took you so?”</p>

<p>“Among other things he said, salvation was not
from hell, but from sin, from error, from mental darkness;
that Jesus came not to save us from eternal
burnings, but to make us good fathers, mothers,<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
brothers, sisters, children, neighbors, friends, citizens.
There is good sense in that.”</p>

<p>“What did he say about the gospel?”</p>

<p>“That it is good news from God to man—that all
sin, suffering and death will be ultimately abolished,
and that God will be all in all. He said, that the
meaning of the word gospel is good news, and that
the whole system corresponds with the signification
of the word.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about hell? Of course he
did not, as there is no hell in his faith.”</p>

<p>“He did not say much on that subject, but gave
notice that this evening he would give the Bible doctrine
of hell, and you had better go and hear what he
has to say. The Orthodox view of religion never
satisfied me, and I am bound to look into this new
faith.”</p>

<p>A society was organized at the close of one of the
meetings, and this man united himself with it.</p>

<p>Spent two days in Weston, Mo., and preached
twice. Agreeably to request, I delivered a discourse
on the destruction of the enemies to God and man,
and took for my text, “The last enemy, death, shall
be destroyed.” 1 Cor. xv. I remarked, 1. Sin is an
enemy to man, but that is to be destroyed. “Behold
the Lamb of God, that taketh away the <cite>sin</cite> of the
world.” “For this purpose was the Son of God
manifested that he might destroy the <cite>works</cite> of the
devil.” Sin, then, is to be destroyed. 2. The devil
is to be destroyed. “Forasmuch as the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, he also took part of the
same; that through death he might destroy him that
hath the power of death, that is, the <cite>devil</cite>.” Thus,
the devil, and all his works, are to be destroyed. 3.
Pain is an enemy to man, and that is to be destroyed.
“There shall be no more <cite>pain</cite>, neither shall there be
<cite>sorrow</cite> nor <cite>crying</cite>, for the former things are passed
away.” How false is the doctrine of endless suffering,<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
endless sorrowing, endless weeping. 4. Hell is
an enemy; but the Scriptures teach, that it is to be
destroyed. “O, <cite>hell</cite>, I will be thy destruction.”
And an apostle asks the triumphant question, “O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, (<cite>hades</cite> or <em>hell</em>)
where is thy victory?” 5. Death is also an enemy,
and it is to be destroyed. We read, “He will swallow
up <em>death</em> in victory, and the Lord God will wipe tears
from all faces.” “There shall be no more <em>death</em>;”
and the text asserts that, “The last enemy, <em>death</em>,
shall be destroyed.” But how can death be destroyed
if millions of mankind are to be eternally the victims
of death? In the language of Dr. Adam Clarke,
“Death is conquered, hell disappointed, the devil
confounded, and sin totally destroyed. Amen! Hallelujah!
The Lord God, omnipotent reigneth! He
shall reign forever and ever!”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this distinct and emphatic testimony,
it is contended by many people, with the Bible
in their hands, that sin, pain, death, hell, and the
devil, will eternally prey on countless multitudes of
our race; and if you intimate to them that those enemies
to our peace and hope will be destroyed, they
cry, delusion, imposture, infidelity. But I trust in
God, and believe in the divine promise of the end of
all evil, and the bringing in of “everlasting righteousness.”</p>

<p>I also lectured in St. Joseph three evenings. At
the close of one of my meetings, a preacher remarked,
“You have been talking about the mercy of God,
but will not God’s wrath last as long as his mercy?”
I replied, without stopping to inquire what is meant
by the wrath or anger of God, the Bible emphatically
declares that “His anger endureth for a <em>moment</em>, but
his mercy from everlasting to everlasting.” Again,
“He retaineth <em>not his anger forever</em>, because he delighteth
in mercy.” “I will <em>not contend forever,
neither will I be always wroth</em>.” Why not? “Because<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
the spirit would fail before me, and the souls
which I have made.” Can you give as good a reason
why he will be always wroth, why he will contend
forever, as he has why he will not? Pain tends to
destroy the sufferer. Let a person endure intense
agony, and if medical aid does not relieve him, death
will soon step in and deliver the sufferer. This is a
merciful provision of our heavenly Father, to prevent
very protracted suffering. The passage just cited
teaches, that God will not permit any one to suffer
long because that suffering would end his existence.
“The spirit would fail before me, and the souls I
have made.” The soul could not endure <em>endless
wrath</em>; it would fail, or cease to be. Jeremiah asks
the question, “Will he reserve his anger forever?
Will he keep it to the end?” Now observe the answer,
“I am merciful saith the Lord, and will <em>not
keep anger forever</em>.” Again it is said, “For his anger
endureth for a <em>moment</em>, weeping may endure for a
night, but joy cometh in the morning.” The prophet
Isaiah records, “In a little wrath I hid my face
from thee for a <em>moment</em>; but with <em>everlasting</em> kindness
will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord.”
Again it is said, “The Lord will not cast off forever,
but though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion
according to the multitude of his tender mercies.”
We read the following, “My mercy will keep
forevermore.” “For the Lord is good; his mercy is
everlasting.” In one Psalm it is twenty-six times
asserted that “The mercy of the Lord <em>endureth forever</em>.”
Hence it is said, “God is <em>rich</em> in mercy.”
“<em>Plenteous</em> in mercy.” We also read of his mercy in
the plural form. They are said to be “great,” “manifold,”
and “over all his works.” The apostle Paul
believed in God’s mercy, for he says, “For he hath
concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
<span class="allsmcap">MERCY ON ALL</span>!”</p>

<p>From all this precious testimony, I conclude that<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
the “wrath of God,” let it mean what it may, will
continue but a <em>moment</em>, while his mercy is as endless
as his own existence. The mother may forget the
son of her love, but God will never forget the souls
he has made. God is merciful to us to-day, he will
be to-morrow, and forever. No circumstance or place
can turn his love into hatred, his goodness into cruelty.
His mercy blesses us in this world, and it will
bless us in the world to come. Death cannot change
the great love God has for the soul.</p>

<p>Delivered a series of discourses in Kingston, on the
following subjects:—“The Character of God”—“Man
as he Is and is to Be”—“Rewards and Punishments”—“The
Future Life”—“The Restitution.”
Our faith was new to the people, as a discourse in its
defense had not been before delivered in the county.
A Baptist minister replied to one of the sermons; he
had traveled ten miles to attend the meeting. He
dwelt on the Rich Man and Lazarus. Denied it
being a parable, and said it was a literal account of
two men in this world, and world to come—one in
heaven and the other in hell—and that their fate in
eternity would be the fate of all mankind—part
would ascend to heaven, and the balance would sink
into the regions of eternal fire.</p>

<p>I replied as follows: If the gentleman is correct in
asserting that the text is to be understood literally,
the following are <span class="allsmcap">FACTS</span>, concerning the Hereafter: 1.
Hell is a <em>place</em>, not a state or condition, but a place;
has a local habitation as well as a name; has length,
width, depth and highth; in fact, is the penitentiary
of the universe. Hell is called in the passage, “this
<em>place</em> of torment.” 2. Hell is a <em>fiery furnace</em>. The
rich man says, “I am tormented in these <em>flames</em>,”
and begs for a drop of water to cool his tongue. 3.
“This place of torment,” this region of fire, is within
speaking distance of heaven. Abraham and the rich
man had a talk on some interesting topics. Heaven<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
and hell, then, are neighbors. They are located side
by side; the division fence being a gulf. 4. If the
fate of those two men is to be the fate of all mankind,
the world is to be divided. Parents and children,
husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, friends and
neighbors, are to be eternally separated—part to be
in heaven, and part in hell.</p>

<p>Now, I want to know if there could be any happiness
in such a heaven. Could parents be happy seeing
their children in hell, as Abraham saw the “rich
man?” Could children be happy, beholding the
mother who bore them, and the father who loved
them, writhing in the liquid flames, the cursed of
God, and the sport of devils? Could the wife behold
the beloved partner of her life, suffering immortal
agony in the fiery furnace, and rejoice and sing
praise? I read a few days since a Presbyterian Sabbath
School report, and the writer states, that “heaven
will be made up of remnants of ruined families.”
Nearly every family will be ruined—a remnant only
will escape the dreadful wreck. To expect happiness
in such a heaven, would be like expecting oranges to
grow on icebergs. But if the gentleman is right in
his interpretation of the passage before us, there is
just such a heaven, and just such a hell; and about
every family will be irredeemably ruined, and eternally
divided. The nearest approach to such a shocking
scene, is a band of naked and painted savages,
laughing and dancing around the blazing stake, at
which their victims are burning. There is your heaven,
and your hell, on a small scale.</p>

<p>But to prevent the denizens of heaven becoming
<em>insane</em> at such a frightful spectacle, it is said, their
<em>memory</em> will be destroyed; they will not remember
they ever had dear friends on earth. Yes, and they
will have to have their <em>eyes</em> put out, for Abraham
could see the rich man. They will also have to be as
deaf as adders, else the cries, groans and lamentations<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
of hell will ever be sounding in their ears. But it
must be evident to every reflecting mind, that the
text is not to be understood <em>literally</em>, but <em>figuratively</em>.
It is doubtless a parable, a fable, and its <em>moral</em> is one
of the most interesting and instructive lessons in the
New Testament.</p>

<p>I have not room here for the interpretation I gave
the passage; but the preacher, at the close, admitted
that the view presented seemed reasonable, and was,
perhaps, correct. A rum-seller here told me, that he
had been through religion, and was satisfied it was
all humbug. I told him that he would, perhaps, be
improved if religion should go <em>through</em> him.</p>

<p>I also lectured several times in Chillicothe. My
subjects were, “Sin”—“Death”—“Hell”—“Salvation.”
One man remarked to me, after hearing the
discourse on Sin,</p>

<p>“Jesus says, ‘If you die in your sins, where God
and Christ are, ye cannot come.’”</p>

<p>“My friend, there is no such passage in the Bible.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but there is,” said he; “I have read it many
a time.”</p>

<p>“But you are mistaken. The passage you quoted
at, reads thus: ‘Then said Jesus again unto them, I
go my way, and ye shall seek me, and ye shall die in
your sins; whither I go ye cannot come.’ John viii.
21. You perceive the true reading is very different
from your version. These words were addressed to
the Jews. A short time afterwards he had occasion
to address his disciples; and mark what he said to
them. ‘Little children, yet a little while I am with
you. Ye shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews,
Whither I go ye cannot come, <em>so say I unto you</em>.’
John xiii. 33. Now, if Jesus when he told the Jews
that they could not go to him, meant they should not
inherit immortal blessedness, he must have meant
the same when he addressed the disciples, for you
perceive, he said precisely the same to them. But<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
nothing of the kind was intended when he addressed
friend or foe. He only meant in both cases, that they
could not much longer follow him from place to place,
as they had been in the habit of doing. He was
about to depart from this world, and they would have
to remain on earth.</p>

<p>“Many of the Jews did die in their sins, but it does
not thence follow that they are condemned to sin forever.
Because a man sins this year it does not follow
he will sin all his life-time. God is not so in love
with sin that he will compel a soul to sin eternally
because this life was mis-spent. What would be
thought of a farmer who compelled a man to cut down
every tree in his orchard because he had cut down one
tree? And will the God of wisdom and goodness,
compel all to sin eternally who die sinners? If yea,
then nearly all mankind will be forever lost, for nearly
all die sinners in some degree. The law is, ‘Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul
and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself.’ Now,
who obeys that law? But few indeed, I fear. Nearly
all mankind, then, will be forever lost if there is
no redemption for those who die sinners.</p>

<p>“But the good Book teaches, that sin will not
debase the soul always; but rather that there is to
be ‘an end of sin.’ Dan. ix. Transferring all sin and
all sinners to hell would not exactly be destroying sin
nor converting sinners to God. It would simply be
removing sin and sinners to another locality—that is
all. Transporting all the drunkards from St. Louis
to Chicago, would not be destroying intemperance.
It would only be removing the curse from one place
to another—nothing more. But when the Bible
talks about sin being <em>destroyed, making an end</em> of
sin, it means just what it says. It does not mean
that it will <em>not</em> be destroyed, will <em>not</em> end its reign.”</p>

<p>From Chillicothe I journeyed to Dewitt. I well
remember of traveling that road at another time. It<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
was one of the hottest days of summer, and I rode
on horseback, from early morn till late at night, in
the blazing sun, without a particle of food. About
mid-day, I called at a house to get a drink of water,
and the good woman conducted me to the back porch
where were two buckets of ice and water—one bucket
for the white folks, and the other for the negroes,
and told me to keep myself to the refreshing contents
of the former. Never shall I forget that blessed
bucket, and its thrice blessed treasure. I thought of
the spring in the desert, gushing forth its cooling
draught; of</p>

<p>While sitting at the breakfast-table, at a boarding-house
in St. Louis, on the morning of the 14th of
April, 1861, it was announced through the morning
paper, that the South Carolinians had fired on Fort
Sumter. I remarked, “The rebels will rue that traitorous
deed.” The landlady took fire, and with eyes
darting vengeance, said, “We are <em>Southrons</em>.” “If
you are <em>Southrons</em> you need not be rebels.” The
whole city was wild with excitement. Americans
had fired on their own flag, civil war was inaugurated;
but how far it would extend, and what would be
the result, were problems the wisest could not solve.
Would the whole land be desolated? Would treason,
with fire and sword, march through the length and
breadth of the country, scattering death and destruction,
where peace, harmony and happiness had so
long prevailed? Was the sun of the Great Republic
about to set, and set in blood, fire and desolation?
Was our glorious Union about to be rent asunder by
profane hands? Where would the division end?
Would it be torn in two, twenty, or thirty parts?
No wonder loyal men and women were excited and
alarmed.</p>

<p>A day or two after the announcement of that insane
act of South Carolina, I heard a man on Fourth street
read a private dispatch he had just received from<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
Senator Douglas at Washington, “<em>Tell my friends
they must sustain the government.</em>” It made my
heart leap for joy, and I exclaimed to a by-stander,
“God bless Douglas.” “God d—— him,” said an
enraged “Southron.” In a few days more, President
Lincoln’s call for volunteers was published; and then
the drum began to beat; and the farmers, mechanics,
merchants, doctors, lawyers, preachers, all over the
land, left their homes and enrolled themselves, “<span class="smcap">Defenders
of our Country</span>.” And many a prayer
went up to heaven for their protection and success.
When General Lyon, a few weeks after, marched five
thousand loyal soldiers through the city and captured
“Camp Jackson,” the union portion of the population
were delighted, but the rebels were dismayed.
For weeks a rebel flag had been hanging over a building
on the corner of Pine and Fifth streets, the head-quarters
of treason, and several leading papers in the
city working to get Missouri out of the Union. These
treason plotters, north and south, east and west, had
great expectations. One of them said to me,</p>

<p>“We shall succeed. The South will sustain itself.
The North will not fight. And having the mouth of
the Mississippi river, the South will compel the Western
States to join them; we shall have a strong and
magnificent government, and the Eastern States may
go to destruction for ought we care.”</p>

<p>I replied: “Three or four years of war will open
your eyes, if you shall have any then to open, with
regard to the North and the South. Do not delude
yourself with the fancy, that the northern people
will not fight for the <em>right</em>; you will find that they
will fight, and as men hardly ever before did fight.
It is true they greatly prefer the arts of peace; but
when their country is in danger, the country for
which their fathers bled and died, you will find that
the spirit of ’76 is not degenerated. You do not
know what you are about; you are insane. You are<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
disturbing a lion, and by and by he will spring to his
feet and crush you to death.”</p>

<p>But after the Camp Jackson affair, and the citizens
were taught by several bloody lessons, to let the soldiers
pass through the streets undisturbed, we had
peace and safety in St. Louis. The rebel element
was strong, but it was harmless amid a preponderance
of loyalty, supported by an army of the “boys in
blue.” But in Missouri, outside of St. Louis, with
the exception of here and there a place where soldiers
were stationed, there was but little peace, or safety.</p>

<p>I had nearly three thousand subscribers in Missouri,
and the Southern States, when the war commenced,
and I lost all the Southern, and nearly all the Missouri
subscribers, by the mails being discontinued,
and by the general confusion that reigned. My loss
was, at least, five thousand dollars. Three religious
periodicals—Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian—were
discontinued at the beginning of the strife. The
former was suppressed by General Lyon, for its treasonable
utterances. The <cite>Magazine</cite> and the <cite>Central
Christian Advocate</cite>, were the only religious journals
that survived the outbreak. The <cite>Magazine</cite> was pretty
badly crippled, and but for the aid it received from
the loyal states, it would have succumbed.</p>

<p>I traveled and preached but little in Missouri during
the war. Most of the men were in the army,
north or south; some left the state, and the few who
remained did not think much about religion. The
society in St. Louis went to the shades. Mr. Weaver
left the year before the war, and located in Lawrence,
Mass., where he has been remarkably successful. He
is a noble man, and an excellent pastor and preacher.
Before a successor to him could be obtained, the war
broke out, and that killed the society. Our cause
was always feeble in St. Louis. The Unitarian society
was old, numerous, well established, and rich; but
instead of aiding us by its sympathy and co-operation,<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
it stood off as cold as an iceberg. I hear much of the
love Unitarians bear for us, but have never seen
much evidence of their love. They doubtless would
like to have Unitarians and Universalists unite, but it
must be like the marriage of man and woman, according
to Blackstone, the twain must be one, and that
one, Unitarian. We are fine fellows if we will allow
ourselves to be swallowed, head and heels, without
kicking.</p>

<p>About this time, I published a pamphlet entitled
“Seventy-two Reasons why Salvation is not by Water
Baptism.” The Reformers, or Campbellites, a
numerous and growing sect in the West and South,
contend, as is well known, that immersion in water is
a condition of salvation. This pamphlet is designed
to refute that strange notion. The following is the
twenty-eighth “Reason”:</p>

<p>“Then said Peter unto them, Repent, and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ,
for the remission of sins; and ye shall receive the
gift of the Holy Ghost.” Acts ii. 38.</p>

<p>If “baptized” here refers to water baptism, it is
the only place in the New Testament where it is connected
with “remission of sin.” And shall all that
Christ and his apostles have said about sin being
removed by grace, hope, faith, repentance, be set
aside, because in one instance baptism and remission
of sins are mentioned in connection with each other?
But even in this passage Peter tells his hearers to
<em>repent</em> “for the remission of sins,” and there is common
sense in that exhortation. Repentance means to
reform, to cease doing evil and learn to do well, and
when that is done, of course, our sins are remitted.
If a drunkard repents, reforms, the sin of intemperance
is remitted, and so of all other sins—when we
abandon them, they abandon us. If we resist the
devil he will flee from us. That is what forgiveness,
pardon, and remission of sin means. And that is<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
what Peter means in the above words, as is evident
from his address to the people in Acts iii. 19. “Repent
ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out.” Here baptism is left out, clearly
showing that the author, in the other place, did not
mean that water puts away sin. The same is taught
by Jesus. “And that <em>repentance</em> and <em>remission of
sins</em> should be preached in his name among all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” Luke xxiv. 47.
Nothing about water. The apostle Paul teaches the
same truth. “Whom God hath sent forth to be a
propitiation through <span class="allsmcap">FAITH</span> in his blood, to declare
his righteousness, for the <span class="allsmcap">REMISSION OF SINS</span>.” Rom.
iii. 25. Here again baptism has no credit for remitting
sin; it is done through faith. Again this apostle
says, “This is the covenant that I will make with
them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
law into their hearts, and in their minds I will write
them: and their sins and iniquities will I remember
no more. Now where <span class="allsmcap">REMISSION</span> of these is, there is
no more offering for sin.” Heb. x. 16, 17, 18. Of
course, when the law of God reigns supreme in men’s
hearts, their sins are remitted, whether they have
been baptized or not. It is the law of love that banishes
sin, not water baptism. It is evident from the
above testimony, that water baptism has nothing to
do in putting away sin, and that the Reformers have
departed far from the truth in their notions about the
saving influence of water baptism.</p>

<p>And here is another error they commit. They are
forever telling us that the kingdom of God was set
up on “the day of Pentecost.” Their notion runs
about thus—Jesus Christ set up his kingdom on
“the day of Pentecost.” The key thereof being
given to Peter, he unlocked it on that occasion, and
commenced baptizing men and women into the kingdom.
Baptism is the door. Not a living man, woman,
or child was inside the door when Peter opened<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
it. On this theological curiosity we have a few
words to offer. 1. We have not a particle of evidence
that the kingdom of God was set up on that
occasion. Peter, who was the sole speaker, said not
one word about the kingdom of God, not one word
about its keys, not one word about unlocking it, not
one word about baptism being the door into the kingdom,
not one word about immersing anybody into it.
If the august kingdom of the living God was really
set up, opened, dedicated, and Jesus commenced his
reign on “the day of Pentecost,” it is very remarkable
that there is not one word said about any of
these important matters by the great apostle. Our
Reformers draw largely on their imagination for
their <em>facts</em> when they expatiate about Pentecost. 2.
Water baptism is the door into the kingdom, is it?
The kingdom, then, which is purely a <em>spiritual</em> institution,
has a <em>material</em> door! What an idea! And it
was reserved for the nineteenth century to make that
wonderful discovery. 3. If our friends are right in
their curious notions, we should like to be informed
how the first one got into the kingdom. When Peter
opened it not a soul was inside, and no one could get
in without being baptized. Now, we should like to
have one of their wise men tell us how the first one
got inside. Did Peter baptize him in? But Peter
was an “outsider.” And will our friends pretend
that one <em>out</em> of the kingdom could lawfully initiate
one <em>into it</em>? This, though, must have been done, or
some one must have slipped inside without immersion,
and then went to work in good earnest putting
others through the watery door into the spiritual
kingdom. 4. If our friends are right, not one of the
twelve apostles entered the kingdom of God, for they
were not baptized <em>before</em>, <em>at</em>, or <em>after</em> Pentecost. Not
even Mathias, who was chosen after the resurrection
of Christ, was baptized. They did not enter through
this singular door. How then can they be saved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[299]</span></p>

<p>Soon after this pamphlet appeared, I made arrangements
with B. H. Smith, pastor of the Reformers’
church in St. Louis, to have a discussion in the <cite>Magazine</cite>
on the efficacy of water baptism. He proposed
affirming that “Water Baptism is a Condition of Salvation.”
He was to write twelve letters. He wrote
seven and then laid aside his pen, and I could never
induce him to write any more. The following is part
of my reply to his first letter:</p>

<p>You advocate a proposition that consigns nearly all
mankind to hopeless ruin. You affirm that water
baptism is a condition of salvation, and consequently
that there is not, and cannot be, any salvation without
immersion in water. Your brethren, generally, adopt
the same theory. Rev. Alexander Campbell, well
known to be a prominent man in your fraternity, distinctly
avows your position. Speaking of the “act of
faith” which he declares to be immersion in water, he
says, “Whatever the <a id="Ref_299" href="#BRef_299">act</a> of faith may be, it necessarily
becomes the line of demarkation between the two
states before described. On this side, and on the other
side, mankind are in quite different states. On one
side they are pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled,
adopted and saved: and on the other, they are in
a state of condemnation. This act is sometimes called
immersion, regeneration, conversion.” (<cite>Christian System</cite>,
page 193.) This “act of faith,” you see, is immersion
in water, and is called “regeneration,” and
“conversion.” On one side, that is, all who are immersed,
are “saved, pardoned, justified, sanctified,
reconciled, adopted,” but those on the other side, that
is, not immersed in water, are condemned, lost, unpardoned,
unsanctified, etc. In one word, immersion
is the line between heaven and hell, between the
saved and the damned, between those God loves and
those he hates. On page 197, he says that “Immersion
is <em>inseparably</em> connected with the remission of
sins,”—“no person was said to be converted until he<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
was immersed; and all persons who were immersed,
were said to be converted.” The same saving power
is attached to immersion all through Mr. Campbell’s
book. But, sir, reason, common sense, common justice,
and every thing else that even <em>squints</em> toward
the true and right, condemn such a theory. But as
you appeal to the New Testament to sustain your
proposition, I trust I can show you misunderstand its
letter and spirit.</p>

<p>Your doctrine of the purifying power of water baptism,
is rank Heathenism. The Pagans, publicly and
privately, used lustral water, which they thought had
the virtue of purifying the soul, and of remitting the
punishment of sins. “The Indians,” writes father
Jesuit Bonchet, a missionary to India, “say that in
bathing—that is, immersing—in certain rivers, sins
are <em>entirely</em> remitted; and that their mysterious waters,
wash not only the bodies, but also purify the
souls in an admirable manner.” This testimony,
Chateaubriand adds, is confirmed by the “Memoirs of
the English Society of Calcutta.” The waters of the
Ganges are supposed by the Hindoos, to purify those
who are immersed in them. This sounds very much
like your proposition. The Catholics, like yourself,
have incorporated this item of Heathenism into their
faith. Their General Catechism treats on baptism
thus:</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is baptism?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A sacrament which cleanses from original sin,
makes us christians and children of God; and heirs
to the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Does baptism also remit the actual sins committed
before it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; and all the punishment due them.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is baptism necessary to salvation?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; without it, we cannot enter the kingdom
of God.</p>

<p>You agree exactly with the Romish Church. Both<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
you and that church contend, that baptism cleanses
the soul, makes us christians, children of God, heirs
of heaven. You say, that “baptism is a condition of
salvation,” and the Pope says, “baptism is necessary
to salvation.” The Pagans call the baptismal water,
“lustral water;” the Catholics, “holy water,” and
your people, “regenerating water.” Mr. Campbell
says, “No one acquainted with Peter’s style, will
think it strange that Paul represents as <em>saved</em>, <em>cleansed</em>,
or <em>sanctified</em> by <em>water</em>—may not he then call that
water, of which a person is born again, the <em>water</em>, or
bath of <em>regeneration</em>.” (<cite>Christian System</cite>, page 265.)
You will observe that you, the Catholics and Pagans,
are beautifully harmonious concerning the saving
power of water.</p>

<p>The savages of the West, appear to be strictly Orthodox
in their notions concerning the regenerating
influence of water. In the early settlement of the
West, two whites were captured by a band of Indians;
and when on the bank of the Ohio, they were
led into the river and immersed by their savage captors.
The chief then informed his prisoners, that this
immersion had changed their characters—that they
were no longer pale faces, but Indians, and were
members of the tribe. We smile at the red man’s
absurdity, but let us be careful and not be equally absurd.
This is the first account we have of a western
stream being deemed a “bath of regeneration;” but
since then another people have christened all the rivers,
creeks and ponds in the West, “baths of regenerations.”</p>

<p>In the course of the correspondence, I offered the
following objections to his theory:</p>

<p>1. “Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the
covenant which God made with our fathers, saying
unto Abraham, and in thy seed shall all the kindreds
of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God having
raised up his Son, Jesus, sent him to bless you, in<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
turning every one of you from his iniquities.” Acts
iii. 25, 26. This is from Peter’s sermon, delivered on
Solomon’s porch, and from which you have quoted in
your argument. Your position is, that salvation is
only for those who are immersed, and as but a very
small part of mankind are immersed, but a small part
of mankind will be blessed with salvation. But the
above passage promises blessedness to “all the kindreds
of the earth,” and we are informed what that
blessing is—“Turning away every one of you from
his <em>iniquities</em>.” That is the blessing, and it is promised
to all mankind. Mr. Campbell, in the book from
which I have before quoted, page 135, admits the <em>universality</em>
of the promise, and says that the “blessing
is <em>spiritual</em> and <em>eternal</em>.” How he or you can restrict
salvation to the <em>few</em> who are immersed, with this passage
before your eyes, and this admission, is a mystery.</p>

<p>2. If you are correct, but a <em>small portion</em> of mankind
will be saved—only those who are immersed in
water. Every child, dying in childhood, every idiot,
every Jew, every Mohammedan, every Pagan, every
Catholic, every Episcopalian, every Methodist, every
Presbyterian, must go to hell, if you are right. You
deny salvation to every body who is not baptized. If
you are correct, hell will be <em>crowded</em>, and heaven
almost <em>empty</em>. My God! what a theory!</p>

<p>3. According to your proposition, a person may
spend three score years and ten in crime of the blackest
dye; may trample under foot the laws of both
God and man, and receive little or no punishment in
this world; and by being immersed the last hour of
his wicked life, his sins are all washed away, and he
occupy as high a seat in heaven as St. John or St.
Paul. Now, the Bible teaches that every transgression
and disobedience shall receive a just recompense
of reward. (Heb. ii. 2.) “He that doeth wrong shall
receive for the wrong which he hath done; and there<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
is no respect of persons.” Col. iii. 25. Your theory
makes a “respect of persons;” it says that the immersed
“shall <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> receive for the wrong which they
have done,” but that wrath and vengeance will be
meted out forever and ever on the unimmersed.
“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of the
Father with his angels; and then shall he reward
every man according to his works.” Matt. xvi. 27.
Mr. Smith affirms, that heaven will render to the <em>unimmersed</em>
“according to their works,” but the immersed
will be saved from the just punishment of
their sins. “For we must all appear before the judgment
seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether good or bad.” 2 Cor. v. 10. Mr.
Smith denies that God will punish the immersed for
the wicked deeds they have done. In fact, his theory
asserts that God will not punish them at all, but saves
them from the penalty of their sins. This, also, is a
very serious objection to your proposition, and I hope
it will receive from you something besides a laugh.</p>

<p>4. A wretch murders in cold blood a thousand unbaptized,
good men, and, according to your proposition,
not one of them can be saved—they die unwashed
of their sins and must be lost. As soon as
he has killed their bodies, and sent their souls to hell,
he attends Mr. Smith’s meetings, on Olive street, listens
to one of his excellent exhortations to come forward
and be immersed into the fold of God. He
gives you his bloody hand, makes the good confession,
and is immersed at the levee—the very spot
where he murdered the men, and some of their dead
bodies are still at his feet. His sins are all forgiven,
his soul is pure, and he is an heir of heaven. But in
going back to the sanctuary, he stumbles over one
of the dead bodies of his victims, falls to the ground
and breaks his neck. He complied with the “conditions
of salvation,” and his sanctified soul is wafted<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
right to heaven. But the thousand victims of his
wickedness, not having been immersed, although they
were righteous men, are lost forever. According to
Mr. Smith’s theory, just such a series of events may
occur. One man may kill a thousand men; their
souls may all go to hell; and the murderer, by faith
and immersion, may be saved from all the consequences
of deeds that have sent thousands to perdition.
The murdered in hell, and the murderer in
heaven. The outrage and injustice of this is a formidable
objection to your proposition. Admit this is an
extreme case; but I want to know how you will dispose
of it?</p>

<p>[A case much like this occurred in St. Louis soon
after this was written. A condemned murderer “believed,”
and was marched from his cell to the Olive
Street church, and was there immersed, and then
marched to the gallows, <i lang="la">via</i> the prison, and if Mr.
Smith is right, thence to heaven, while his victim
likely was sent to hell.]</p>

<p>5. One sin may ruin a soul forever without immersion,
but a million sins are harmless if followed by
immersion. To illustrate: a man commits one sin,
and dies without being immersed. You say, he cannot
be saved, for immersion is a condition of salvation.
Another commits a million of sins, and is immersed
immediately after committing the last one, and, having
complied with the conditions of salvation, he is
saved. Can you see any equity in this? Even if it
is possible for a child, dying ere it attains the age of
accountability to be saved, suppose it lives to commit
one sin, and dies without being immersed, according
to Mr. Smith, it cannot be saved. It sinned <em>once</em> and
died without immersion, died with that sin unforgiven,
and consequently it cannot be saved.</p>

<p>6. A serious objection to Mr. Smith’s view of baptism,
is its arbitrary character. There is naturally no
power in water, or immersion in water, to cleanse the<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
soul; and making its salvation depend on the body
being dipped in water, sets aside all natural and spiritual
laws. All God’s commands, in the New Testament,
are based in sound philosophy, and are in perfect
harmony with all nature; nothing is arbitrary;
all is natural and philosophical. But the doctrine of
salvation by immersing the body in water, is in direct
variance with God’s method of government, and
therefore must be false.</p>

<p>7. If Mr. Smith is right, a wonderful miracle is
wrought whenever he or his brethren immerse a man
or woman in water. Mr. Campbell says, “I am bold
to affirm that every one of them who, in the belief of
which the apostle spoke, was immersed did, in the
very instant in which he was put under the water,
receive the forgiveness of his sins.” (<cite>Christian Baptist</cite>,
pages 416, 417.) The believer is cursed with all
his sins, exposed to the wrath of God and the flames
of hell, till the <em>very instant he is put under water</em>.
When under the water his sins are all forgiven, his
soul is purified, his nature is changed, God becomes
his friend, and the door of heaven is opened to him.
All this takes place during the brief time he is under
the water. What a miracle! There is nothing in the
catalogue of miracles equal to it. And then such
wonderful miracles are being wrought day and night
in every stream and pond in the land. If there is
any truth in this theory, Mr. Smith has performed far
more miracles than Jesus Christ ever did. His brethren
often laugh at the Methodists, for their notions
about the operations of the spirit, and tell them they
suppose a miracle is wrought, whenever a soul is converted;
but Mr. Smith and his friends believe in
greater wonders than the Methodists do, and those
too that are not half as reasonable and philosophical.</p>

<p>8. This theory suspends salvation on the will and
act of another man. To illustrate: Mr. Smith convinces
one of his hearers of the truth of the gospel,<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
and he makes application to be immersed that his sins
may be pardoned. Mr. Smith does not doubt his
faith, but refuses to immerse him—has an old grudge
against him—and the man dies the next day, dies
unforgiven, and enters into the presence of his God
with all his sins on his soul. Now, Mr. Smith, by
not doing his duty, has sent that man to hell. It may
be said, that Mr. Smith will be sent there too for this
sin of omission; but that would not help the poor
man who went there before him. If this doctrine is
correct, thousands may be lost by others refusing to
immerse them. Again: a son or a daughter becomes
a penitent believer, and desires to be immersed, but
the father forbids it, and the youth dies unimmersed,
and consequently goes to perdition. It may be replied,
that God does not require impossibilities, and
in those cases he will take the will for the deed. But
Mr. Smith affirms, there is no salvation without baptism.
If Mr. Smith is right, all such unfortunate persons
are lost.</p>

<p>9. This system enjoins an impossibility, and then
damns a man for not performing it. On the desert a
man becomes a penitent believer, but dies ere he can
reach water in which to be immersed. A traveler in
the arctic regions makes the good confession, but
freezes to death before he can melt water enough to
be dipped in. All such souls are lost, for Mr. Smith
and Mr. Campbell tell us, there is no salvation on the
desert, nor in the polar regions, without immersion.
And this is called the glorious gospel of the blessed
God! A solitary traveler in an uninhabited region,
exclaims from the heart, “I believe that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God,” and wills to be immersed; but he
is in a bad fix. There is no one within an hundred
miles to immerse him, and he cannot immerse himself.
He makes a desperate effort to find somebody
to immerse him, as the salvation of his soul depends
on his success. But his effort is fruitless, his exertion<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
brings on a fever, and he dies alone on the desert.
According to Mr. Smith, he goes into the other world
a sinner, and as there is no water there to be immersed
in, he must be immersed in hell-fire, not for a moment,
but for all eternity.</p>

<p>10. It encourages superstition by attaching an extravagant
importance to immersion. It elevates an
ordinance far above every Christian virtue; above
faith, hope, charity, love. In fact, it makes almost
a god of water baptism.</p>

<p>11. Mr. Smith’s superstitious notions of baptism
lead directly to infant baptism—are the father and
mother of infant baptism. Speaking of the origin of
infant baptism, the learned historian and critic, Salmasins,
says, “An opinion prevailed that no one
could be saved without being baptized, and for that
reason the custom arose of baptizing infants.” Professor
Hahn testifies to the same: “Infant baptism
arose from false views of original sin, and of the magical
power of consecrated water.” (<cite>Prof. Hahn’s Theology</cite>,
page 556.) Another noted critic says: “The
immediate occasion of infant baptism it cannot be
denied was its extravagant ideas of its necessity to
salvation.” (<cite>Dressler’s Doctrine of the Sacrament of
Baptism.</cite>)</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that Mr. Smith’s idea of water
baptism is the legitimate parent of infant baptism;
and it is a mystery to me that he and his brethren do
not baptize infants to save their souls. According to
Mr. Campbell they need salvation. Hear him: “Our
<em>nature</em> was <em>corrupted</em> by the fall of Adam before it
was transmitted to us; and hence the hereditary imbecility
to do good, and that proneness to do evil, so
universally apparent in all human beings. All inherit
a <em>fallen</em>, consequently a <em>sinful</em> nature.” (<cite>Christian
System</cite>, pages 28, 29.) Now, as there is no salvation
without baptism, why not baptize infants? Will it
not save <em>little</em> sinners as well as large ones? It would<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
not astonish me to learn that Mr. Smith is immersing
infants. I wonder he has not been doing it these
many years.</p>

<p>12. According to my friend’s theology, a man may
be full of faith, and love, and good works, but if he
has not been immersed in water he is in a lost and
ruined condition, and on the broad road to everlasting
destruction. His faith, and love, and good works,
avail nothing without immersion. Stating such a
proposition in simple language is enough to condemn
it.</p>

<p>13. This theory is worse than infidelity. Thomas
Paine, the noted infidel, says, “I believe that religious
duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and
endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy.”
(<cite>Age of Reason</cite>, page 6.) According to the theory in
question, our Creator has no respect for these religious
duties, unless we are immersed in water. He
will neither bless us with salvation in time or eternity,
if we religiously perform all these duties, unless we
are immersed. With all due respect to my friend, I
must say, that of the two systems, Paine’s is the best,
as far, at least, as religious duties are concerned. My
correspondent will doubtless reply, that he believes in
the duties Paine names, and urges his fellow men to
observe them. No doubt of it; but then he spoils his
faith and exhortation, by telling his hearers, that the
observing of them will avail nothing in the way of
salvation without immersion in water.</p>

<p>14. This theory is worse than Calvinism. With all
its cruelty and savagism, it does not make our salvation
depend on immersion in water, whether there is
any water to be immersed in or not, whether our
health will admit of immersion or not; whether we
can find one qualified to immerse or not, and whether
if we find such an one he will accommodate us or not.</p>

<p>15. We have not a particle of evidence that one of
the twelve disciples of our Lord was immersed. Matthew,<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
one of the number, thus records the call and
acceptance of several of that chosen band. “And
Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
Simon and Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting
a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And
he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you
fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets
and followed him. And going on from thence he
saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee,
and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their
father, mending their nets; and he called them.
And they immediately left the ship and their father,
and followed him.” Matt. iv. 18-22. In the tenth
chapter we are informed of the other disciples being
called. There is not the slightest intimation in the
New Testament that one of the disciples was immersed
when they were chosen by the Master, or at any
subsequent time.</p>

<p>16. My friend maintains, that immersion is the door
to discipleship, to the kingdom, to salvation, pardon,
heaven. If he is right, is it not remarkable that there
is not a particle of evidence, that one of our Lord’s
disciples entered that door? When some of them
were called, they were on the shore of the sea, but
not a word is recorded of their being immersed to
prepare them for their mission. Never afterward
did they speak or write of being immersed, nor did
any others refer to it. The unavoidable inference is,
that they were not baptized in water, and so according
to Mr. Smith, their sins were never forgiven, they
were not saved, never members of the kingdom of
God. But let Mr. Smith and his friends ponder well
the fact, that men in those days could be disciples of
Jesus without immersion. Why not now?</p>

<p>17. This theory is immoral in its influence, as it
affirms that the unimmersed are under no obligation
to do any thing which implies spiritual life. The following
are Mr. Campbell’s remarkable words: “No<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
prayers, songs of praise, no acts of devotion in the
new economy, are enjoined on the unbaptized.”
(<cite>Christian Baptist</cite>, page 439.) If Mr. Campbell is
right, it is a great sin for any one who has not been
immersed in water to perform any of these acts.
Ministers, then, of all denominations, except immersionists
and their congregations, spend each returning
Sabbath, not in serving God, but in open rebellion
against him. Christians, all over the world, morning,
noon and evening, in offering their prayers to God,
and singing his praise, are guilty of heinous sins.
They do what they have no right to do. Their prayers,
their songs, and all their devotions, are so many
sins against heaven, and for which, by and by, they
will be turned into hell. Such teachings can have no
other than an immoral influence.</p>

<p>18. On page 204, of “Christian System,” Mr.
Campbell has the following curious remark: “And
we know so much of human nature as to say, that he
that <em>imagines</em> himself pardoned, will feel as <em>happy</em> as
he that really is so.” This is in reply to an objection,
that according to his theory, no one can be saved,
pardoned, without immersion in water. His reply is,
that there is no evidence such can be saved; but they
can <em>imagine</em> themselves saved, pardoned; can <em>fool</em>
themselves into the idea that they are pardoned, yet
full of sin all the time, and will be just as happy as
they would be if their sins were all forgiven, and
their souls pure as the angels. Where he got his
mental philosophy I know not, but surely not from
the Bible. According to this wisdom, a man, drunk
and wallowing in the gutter, if he imagines himself a
sober man and virtuous citizen, “will feel as happy
as he that really is so.” Or a murderer, with innocent
blood on his hands, and murder in his heart, if
he only imagines he is innocent, “will feel as happy
as he that really is so.” All such absurd notions
proceed from the position of my friend, that there is<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
no salvation, no forgiveness, without immersion in
water.</p>

<p>19. The Scriptures teach that all sin is to be forgiven.
“All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of
men.” “Every plant which my heavenly Father
hath not planted, shall be rooted up.” The angel
told Joseph, “Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
shall save his people from their sins.” Matt. i. 21.
John, the forerunner of Jesus, pointed to him and
said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.” John i. 29. Many more passages
might be cited, showing that all sin is to be forgiven,
abolished, taken away, made an end of. Now,
my friend’s theory is, that no sin can be forgiven
without the aid of water baptism. But only a small
portion of mankind are immersed, and therefore, if he
is right, all those scriptures which teach the extinction
of sin, are so many mistakes. If all sin is to be forgiven,
Mr. Smith is mistaken.</p>

<p>20. “And we have seen, and do testify, that the
Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.”
1 John iv. 14. The men of Samaria, after hearing
Jesus speak of his mission, went away and said, “We
have heard him ourselves and know that this is the
Christ, the Savior of the world.” John iv. 42. If
Christ was sent by the Father to save the world, and
if he saves only the few who are immersed in water,
instead of saving <em>the world</em>, he will save but a very
<em>small part</em> of it; instead of doing his Father’s business,
he will leave most of it undone. How can you
reconcile these precious promises with your very partial
salvation?</p>

<p>21. “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall
the prince of this world be cast out, and I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, will draw <span class="allsmcap">ALL MEN</span> to me.”
John xii. 31, 32. According to my friend, we can go
to Christ only <em>through immersion</em>, and as but a small
part of all men are immersed, the conclusion is, that<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
only a small part of mankind can go to Christ. But
this conclusion from Mr. Smith’s premises contradicts
the Savior. Jesus says, he will draw all men to him.
It is clear that my friend’s theory contradicts the
letter and spirit of the New Testament.</p>

<p>22. “As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall
all be made alive.” 1 Cor. xv. 22. When Jesus
shall have made an end of sin, saved the world,
drawn all men to him, then will all who die in Adam
be in Christ. But Mr. Smith contends that no one
can get into Christ, save by immersion. That is a
fundamental point with him; but as ultimately all
men are to be in Christ, he must be mistaken. Try,
my friend, to reconcile your faith with that glorious
passage. Nearly all mankind die without being water-immersed
into Christ. All children, idiots, Jews,
Pagans, Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists,
Lutherans, Friend Quakers, Unitarians, Universalists,
and hosts of other Christians, live and die
without being immersed into Christ, and it follows
from your proposition, they never can be in Christ;
never can be saved from their sins. None of these,
you assert, have their sins forgiven in this world.
Pray, tell what will become of us all? You have
evaded this question long enough. I have urged you
to let us sinners know what is to be our fate beyond
the grave. We know what is the condition of all
these classes in this world, according to Mr. Smith’s
theory—they are all sinners, all condemned, all out
of Christ, all out of the kingdom, children of the
devil, without God and without hope in the world.
Now, it surely is not impertinent to insist that Mr.
Smith tell us, plainly and without equivocation, what
is to be the doom of these countless millions beyond
the grave. I charge his system with involving the
endless sinfulness and wretchedness of all these multitudes
of Adam’s race. If I am mistaken, let him
show wherein I am. Let us have no more of this<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
dodging. It looks bad, very bad, on the part of my
friend, to evade this point as he has done.</p>

<p>23. The apostle Paul writes, “Christ sent me not
to baptize, but to preach the gospel.” 1 Cor. i. 17.
This is surely a remarkable declaration, if water baptism
is a soul-saving institution. If he had believed
that water baptism is a condition of salvation, would
he have said he was not sent to baptize? According
to Mr. Smith’s understanding, where Paul speaks
about “obeying the gospel,” he means baptism. If
Mr. Smith is right, Paul was not sent to induce men
to obey the gospel. Again: Paul labored for the conversion
of souls, and Mr. Smith says, conversion is
baptism. Then the apostle was not sent to be instrumental
in converting men. If the gentleman is correct,
the great apostle was not sent to labor for men’s
salvation, or their conversion, or to induce them to
obey the gospel. This all follows, if water baptism is
a condition of salvation, for Paul declares, that he was
not sent to baptize; that is, was not sent to do the
very thing that must be done to insure salvation.
This declaration of the apostle, that he was not sent
to baptize, is a perfect refutation of Mr. Smith’s proposition,
that water baptism is a condition of salvation.</p>

<p>24. In looking over Mr. Campbell’s “Christian
System,” page 60, I find the following wonderous
things, said to be consummated by dipping a man or
woman in water: “The change which is consummated
by immersion, is sometimes called in sacred style,
‘being quickened,’ ‘made alive,’ ‘passed from death
to life,’ ‘being born again,’ ‘having risen with Christ,’
‘turning to the Lord,’ ‘being enlightened,’ ‘conversion,’
‘reconciliation,’ ‘repentance unto life.’” In
another place, he asserts the subject comes out of the
water as “pure as an angel.” But mark, no one can
be thus purified, quickened, made alive, etc., without
water baptism, and yet, St. Paul says, he was not sent
to baptize. If that apostle believed in baptism, as<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
Mr. Smith does, would he have made that remark?</p>

<p>25. Mr. Campbell again says, “Baptism is <em>designed</em>
to introduce the subjects of it into the participation
of the blessings of the death and resurrection of
Christ.” “To the believing penitent, it is the means
of receiving a formal, distinct, and specific absolution,
or release from guilt.” (page 58.) Baptism is <span class="allsmcap">THE
MEANS</span> by which God <em>designs</em> to confer all these immortal
and heavenly blessings on men, and yet one
of his greatest apostles declares, he was not sent to
baptize; that is, was not sent to use <em>the means</em> by
which alone men can participate in these blessings.</p>

<p>26. Hear Mr. Campbell again: “The converts
made to Christ, by the apostles, were taught to consider
themselves pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled,
adopted, saved.” (page 187.) He then devotes
several pages to show that the <em>immersed</em> only are in
this condition, or state. Only those who submit to
the <em>act</em>, as he terms it, of immersion, are in this new
and changed condition, and yet the chief of the apostles
tells the world, he was not sent to baptize; that
is, was not sent to do <em>the act</em> which alone can put men
into a saved state or condition.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1861, I resolved to move to Chicago,
and publish the <cite>Magazine</cite>, in that city. The war
was still raging, and I was apprehensive it would
linger several years longer. I could do nothing in
Missouri, and most of my subscribers were nearer
Chicago than St. Louis. Accordingly, in May of said
year, we bid adieu to the city which had been our
home for many years, and took up our abode in the
“Garden City” of the West. I had been there but
once since 1840, and what a change had taken place!
Its population at the present time, is about two hundred
thousand, but in 1840 it did not number more
than six thousand inhabitants. And it will doubtless
continue to make rapid strides in its onward march.
Its lake navigation almost connecting it with the Atlantic
ocean; its railroads extending in all directions
through the most productive agricultural region of
the world, must concentrate immense wealth and
business in Chicago.</p>

<p>Our denomination has two church edifices in Chicago,
and two large societies. Dr. W. H. Ryder is
pastor of the first society, and T. E. St. John of the
second. Till recently, J. H. Tuttle had charge of the<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
second society. There is also a denominational paper
there—<cite>The New Covenant</cite>—published by D. P.
Livermore. It has, I understand, an extensive circulation.</p>

<p>There are far more of the liberal faith in this northern
region than as far south as St. Louis. A large
portion of the people are from the Eastern States, and
they brought with them rational views of the Bible
and religion. We have meeting-houses and societies
all over this northern section, also ministers at work
instructing the people, and uniting and concentrating
their efforts.</p>

<p>Soon after moving to Chicago, I had an oral discussion
in Pontiac, Ill., with Elder Brooks, on Endless
Misery and Universal Salvation. In one of my
speeches, I remarked:</p>

<p>The apostle Paul was certainly a believer in the
salvation of all men. Some of his statements of this
doctrine are remarkably lucid, comprehensive, and
weighty. Take, for instance, the fifth chapter to the
Romans.</p>

<p>1. In the eighteenth verse he says: “Therefore, as
by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men
to condemnation; even so, by the righteousness of
one the <em>free gift</em> came upon <em>all men</em> unto justification
of life.” What is this “free <em>gift</em>” to all men?
Answer: “For the wages of sin is death; but the
<em>gift of God is eternal life</em>.” Rom. vi. 23. Eternal
life, then, is given, made sure, to <em>all men</em>. Not to
one here and there; to this sect or that sect; this
nation or that nation; but to <span class="allsmcap">ALL MEN</span>. Let this be
remembered.</p>

<p>2. In the next verse of said chapter, he continues:
“For as by one man’s disobedience, many were made
sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be
made righteous.” By “many” here he means the
same as by “all men,” in the preceding verse, the
terms being varied to avoid tautology. Parkhurst, in<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
his Greek Lexicon says, “The word <em>many</em> in this
verse, signifies <em>the many</em>; that is, the <em>mass</em>, the multitude;
the <em>whole bulk</em> of mankind.” Dr. Macknight,
a Presbyterian critic, writes, “For as the word <em>many</em>
in the first part of the verse, does not mean some part
of mankind only, but <em>all mankind</em>, from first to last,
who without exception are constituted sinners; so <em>the
many</em>, in the latter part of the verse, who are said to
be constituted righteous through the obedience of
Christ, must mean <em>all mankind</em>, from the beginning
to the end of the world, <em>without exception</em>.” The
statement of the apostle is this—all mankind are sinners,
and all mankind shall be righteous. Can universal
salvation be expressed in clearer terms?</p>

<p>3. He continues his argument: “Where sin abounded,
grace did much more abound; and as sin hath
reigned unto death, even so, might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus
Christ our Lord.” Verses 20, 21. Sin abounds universally,
but grace is much more to abound. The
grace of God is not only to banish sin from every
soul, but to bless every soul forever and ever. But
how can grace abound more than sin, if millions of
mankind are to be victims of sin eternally? Will the
grace of God, resulting in eternal life, abound in
such souls? A valuable building is on fire; the fire
abounds in every part from base to attic. The engines
rush to the spot and pour water all over the
building, and extinguish the devouring flames. In
this case where fire abounded, water much more
abounds. But if the water failed to extinguish the
fire in one half of the building, would water have
abounded more than fire? So, if the grace of God
puts out the fires of sin in only half of the universe,
will grace abound more than sin? How is that,
Elder Brooks?</p>

<p>4. The whole creation to be delivered. “For the
creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly but<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope;
because the creature itself shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
children of God.” Rom. viii. 20, 21. The word, “creature,”
here means mankind; the Greek whence it is
taken, is rendered “creation” in the twenty-second
verse. The words, “every creature,” in the commission
of Christ to his apostles, are from the same term.
“Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to
<em>every creature</em>.” Mark xvi. 15. Dr. Macknight and
other good critics tell us, that the word rendered, <em>creature</em>,
signifies, “<em>every human creature</em>; <span class="allsmcap">ALL MANKIND</span>.”
Dr. Thomas White, an English divine of the Episcopal
Church, translates the text thus: “For <span class="allsmcap">THE CREATION</span>
was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected it; in hope that
<span class="allsmcap">THE CREATION ITSELF</span> also shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the
sons of God.” Mankind, then, are to be delivered
from corruption—from moral and physical corruption—into
the glorious liberty of the children of God.
The apostle says, this universal deliverance <span class="allsmcap">SHALL</span> be
effected, and I believe him.</p>

<p>5. God will have mercy on all. “For I would not,
brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness
of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel
shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out
Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness
from Jacob: for this is my covenant unto them,
when I shall take away their sins. As concerning
the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as
touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’
sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without
repentance. For as ye in times past have not believed
God, yet have now obtained mercy through their
unbelief: even so have these also now not believed,<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he
might have mercy upon all. O the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past finding out? For who hath known the mind of
the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? Or who
hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
unto him again? For of him, and through him, and
to him, are all things; to whom be glory for ever.
Amen.” Rom. xi. 25-36. Jews and Gentiles include
all mankind. The apostles tell us, that the blindness
of the Jews is to continue “Till the <em>fulness</em> of the
Gentiles be come in,” and then “<em>All Israel</em> shall be
saved.” “For God hath concluded them <em>all</em>—Israelites
and Gentiles—in unbelief that he might
have mercy on <em>all</em>.” And then he adds, “For of
him, and through him, and to him are <em>all things</em>, to
whom be glory forever. Amen.” No terms can express
more forcibly the proposition I affirm on this
occasion.</p>

<p>In the next verse, the apostle adds, “I beseech you
therefore by the <em>mercies</em> of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable duty.” In the previous part
of his letter to the Romans, as I have shown, he
writes of the <em>mercies</em> of God for mankind. 1. “The
free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”
2. “Many,” that is, the mass, all mankind, “shall be
made righteous.” 3. “Where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound.” 4. The whole creation
shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption.
5. God will bring all the Gentiles, and all the Jews,
into the kingdom; will “<span class="allsmcap">HAVE MERCY ON ALL</span>; for
of him and through him, and to him are <span class="allsmcap">ALL THINGS</span>.”
His next words are, “I beseech you therefore by the
<span class="allsmcap">MERCIES</span> of God,” etc. It is sometimes said by the
opposers of Universal Grace, that it has an immoral<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
influence. But the great apostle beseeches men in
consideration of its truth, to live holy, godly lives.
He does not say, as some have profanely said, “If
God’s mercy will save the world, we have nothing to
do; let us then eat, drink and be merry; lie, steal,
and murder. It is all right; God will save us any
how.” Let every believer in the universal mercy of
God aim to live a life “holy and acceptable to God,”
which is his reasonable duty.</p>

<p>These are the statements of the apostle to the Gentiles
concerning the extent of salvation; and I, and
no other one, can employ language expressing more
clearly the Universalist faith. That gifted man was
certainly a believer in the “Restitution of all things.”</p>

<p>Since I have been in Chicago, I have traveled and
lectured on nearly all the railroads running out of the
city; have labored not only in Illinois, but in Indiana,
Ohio, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. I was at
work in Kansas and Missouri when Price made his
late raid into the latter state. That was in the fall of
1864. Was in Leavenworth when the state militia
were called out to resist the invaders. The people of
Kansas expected no mercy at their hands should they
enter the state; Leavenworth, especially, would be
sure to feel their wrath. The streets of the city were
guarded, and orders issued, to arrest every straggler
who was without a pass. Cannon were mounted on
the surrounding hills, and every man who could
shoulder a musket was required to report for duty. I
was tempted to go, armed and equipped, to the
“front,” but recollecting I had not fired a gun for twenty
years, I concluded I could not do much execution,
and so set my face homeward. But how to get across
the river into Missouri, was the question, as no one
was allowed to go over without a pass, and I had no
pass, and probably could not get one. I, however,
rode boldly to the ferry as if I was on important business,
and was passed over without being questioned.<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
But when near Weston, I was stopped by the picket;
but the officer of the day soon coming along, took me
to head-quarters, where I obtained a pass to St. Joseph.
Leaving my horse with a kind friend, I went
to St. Joseph by rail, and thence to the Mississippi
river, two hundred miles across the state. Considerable
portion of the way being infested with bushwackers,
there were thirty soldiers on the train to protect
us from those bloody scoundrels. The guards fired
on two horsemen, who seemed to be fleeing from the
rushing train. Both fell, and as I learned afterward,
they were killed, and were Union men. The conductor
thought they were bushwackers, and that class
of fighters were shot down like mad dogs, as they
deserved to be. Only a few days before, and a few
miles from that spot, Bill Anderson’s bloody crew
stopped a train, and murdered in cold blood twenty-one
of the passengers. All armed stragglers on the
prairies, were suspiciously regarded in that locality,
after that terrible crime was perpetrated. Macon
City was alive with business, fifteen hundred soldiers
being there digging ditches, throwing up breastworks,
and making every other necessary preparation to
resist an attack, which was daily expected. I went to
St. Louis, and found the citizens very indignant at
the way General Rosecrans was managing affairs.
Half of a general, with the force at Rosecrans’ command,
would have driven Price out of the state at the
beginning of the invasion, when he was yet in the
south-east corner of it. But Rosecrans’ head being
full of whisky and popery, he let the rebels do about
as they pleased. They overran the best portion of
the state, and did an immense amount of harm.</p>

<p>I spent three weeks, in the business of my life,
between Chicago and Toledo, Ohio. Lectured in
many places I had not before visited, and much
extended my acquaintance. Had an appointment in
East Toledo, a suburb of Toledo, and about three<span class="pagenum">[322]</span>
miles from it. It was a dismal night, and the road
out there was a dismal road. I started after dark, on
foot and alone, to fill the appointment. The weather
was cold, the night dark, and the rain pouring down
in torrents. There being no sidewalk, and the mud
deep, I had an interesting walk. Arriving at the
meeting-house, I found it dark, and the door locked;
and after shivering in the wet and cold outside one
hour, and not a soul joining me, I returned whence I
came. I suppose no one expected I would be on
hand such a night. The next day on the cars, I had
the following conversation with a fellow passenger:</p>

<p>“I do not believe in eternal punishment. I believe
God will <em>destroy</em> the wicked, soul and body, root and
branch.”</p>

<p>“When will he do all this?”</p>

<p>“At the resurrection. Then God will raise saint
and sinner, take the righteous to himself, and burn
the wicked to ashes.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you on the improvement you have
made on old Orthodoxy. It is certainly better to
burn sinners up, then burn them eternally.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe any one in this world has a spark
of immortality in him. We are born mortal, live
mortal, and unless we comply with certain conditions,
we never can be immortal. Immortality is conditional,
and unless we comply with those conditions,
we shall be consumed in the conflagration.”</p>

<p>“What are those conditions?”</p>

<p>“Faith in Christ, is one of them.”</p>

<p>“Will all be destroyed except those who exercise
faith in Christ? Is that your theory?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then nearly all mankind will be burned up. The
countless millions who lived before Christ’s advent—the
good and the bad—all consumed in one pile.
All the Pagans, Mohammedans, and Jews who have
lived since his birth will share the same fiery fate.<span class="pagenum">[323]</span>
All idiots, all children who have died such, will be
consumed with them. Your creed is the gospel of
destruction, almost universal destruction.”</p>

<p>“I did not say all them would be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“I admit you did not say so in so many words, but
no other inference can be drawn from your position.
You said no one would be blessed with immortality
and eternal life, who did not have faith in Christ in
this world. The child, the idiot, the Pagan, the Mohammedan,
all lack such a faith here, and the inference
is, they will all be destroyed. You are ashamed
to admit in so many words such a horrid idea to me,
but that is your faith.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand me, and you cannot convince
the people of the White House that all will be
saved.”</p>

<p>“I understand you and your fiery faith perfectly
well. It is worse than Atheism, for it asserts that
death is the end of man, while your creed asserts,
that nearly all mankind will be raised from the dead
on <em>purpose to burn them up</em>. Atheism is a hundred
fold better than your theory. It is amazing to me,
that a man with the Bible in his hands, and God all
round him, can entertain such a terrible theory. You
have eyes, but you see not; ears, but you hear not;
understanding, but understand not. Read the words
of truth emblazoned on God’s word and works, accept
their teachings, and abandon your fiery creed,
your worse than atheistical dogma.”</p>

<p>Spent one month on the Illinois Central railroad,
and went south as far as Du Quoin, about three hundred
miles, and lectured in most of the important
towns, on and near the road. When in Mattoon and
Charleston, the glorious news arrived of the evacuation
of Richmond, and the surrender of Lee. Up
went the banners, and loud were the hosannas. Every
body were in the street, shaking hands, and with
smiling faces. The terrible war was over, the government<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
was triumphantly sustained, and the soldier
boys would soon return. No wonder the people were
happy.</p>

<p>I was in Ashley, April 14th. Some one said,
“Have you heard the news?” “What news?”
“Mr. Lincoln was murdered last night!” “It cannot
be so,” I replied; “it is doubtless a false report?”
But in a few moments, the passenger train came down
with its engine draped in black. That confirmed the
heart-rending report. As the train approached the
depot no one spoke—no one could speak. The people
turned homeward with meditative steps and down
cast look. All over the land, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, in city and country, where the sad tidings was
conveyed, the people were struck dumb. Mr. Lincoln’s
character had been tested by the most difficult
circumstances, and he had proved himself to be a
wise, noble, far-seeing man. Every body had confidence
in him—in his judgment, his uprightness, his
patriotism. He was deemed the Savior of his country.
No wonder the people were “stricken, smitten
and afflicted.” And then, the awful news was so different
from what the people had just been feasting
on. This was victory, victory, victory. The enemy
was subdued, and the country saved. That was
death, death, death. The great, the good, the beloved
President, was murdered, and that, too, in the
very hour of his triumph.</p>

<p>I was at Du Quoin the next day; and it was reported
of three men in town, that they had said, “Lincoln
was served right,” and forthwith some soldiers,
who were at home on a furlough, started post-haste,
and brought them into town. They would have been
hung, if it had been proved they dropped those obnoxious
words.</p>

<p>I had a discussion in Milford, Ohio, with John
Sweeney of Chicago, which continued four days.
He was pretty well posted on doctrinal points, and<span class="pagenum">[325]</span>
did some good work for his cause. The discussion
was conducted pleasantly, and I trust profitably to
the hearers. He said, that the idea of the salvation
of all men was new in the world; had been entertained
but a few years. In my reply I remarked:</p>

<p>The gentleman greatly errs in asserting that the
idea of the final purification and salvation of all souls,
is a new thought in this world. The apostle Peter
informs us, that the “Restitution of all things was
spoken by the mouth of all God’s holy prophets since
the world began.” Acts iii. 21. It is as old, then, as
inspiration, as revelation. And far back in the depths
of the past, hundreds of years before Christ, and outside
of the Jewish nation, the “Restitution of all
things” was cherished by many of the wise and
good. Upper India was doubtless one of the first
abodes of mankind after the flood, Noah or some of
his children, having settled there. In the sacred
books of the early inhabitants of that country, the
redemption of all souls is distinctly stated. Budhism,
a sort of Protestant Reformation of the old
faith of the people, avows the same destiny for mankind.
Padmahani, the Son of the Supreme God, made
a vow not to return to heaven until all beings should
be brought through him to salvation. True, they
were to pass through many terrible hells—first, a
hell of snakes, then came thirty-two principal hells,
and then one hundred and twenty minor hells. The
road to heaven, according to that old theology, was
certainly hard to travel; but I suppose one had better
go to heaven through all those hells than not get
there at all. The author of the “Friend of India,”
gives the following as the views of many of the present
inhabitants of that country. “According to the
Brahmos, God is a loving Father, and men are his
children; to secure happiness, men must avoid sin
and subdue the sins to which they are prone. They
must fulfil all human duty, and especially devote<span class="pagenum">[326]</span>
themselves to works of benevolence among the ignorant
and poor. For the wrong they do, they will suffer
punishment; <em>but their sufferings are remedial, and
will purify the soul from all its errors</em>. Meditation
and prayer are to be employed for the same end; and
to assist their followers in this duty, a little book has
been published, which is extensively used.”</p>

<p>In Egypt, the land of ancient wisdom, many of the
priests, Dr. Enfield thinks, entertained a belief in the
salvation of all men. See his “History of Philosophy,”
Book I, chapter 8. In the old Persian mythology,
the same idea is contained. It has a God and a
Savior; and the latter will finally restore all from the
power of satan.</p>

<p>For three or four hundred years after Christ, many
of the leading Christian writers were believers in the
“Restitution of all things.” Says Clement, President
of the theological school in Alexandria, the most
noted school of the second and third centuries:
“How is he a Savior and Lord, unless he is the Savior
and Lord of all? He is certainly the Savior of
those who have believed: and of those who have not
believed he is the Lord, until by being brought to
confess him they shall receive the proper and well-adapted
blessing for themselves.” “The Lord is the
propitiation not only for our sins, that is, of the faithful,
but also for the whole world; therefore he indeed
<em>saves all</em>, but converts some by punishments, and others
by gaining their free-will, so that he has the high
honor that unto him <em>every knee should bow</em>, of things
in heaven, on earth, and under the earth; that is, angels,
men, and the souls of those who died before his
advent.”</p>

<p>Clement’s great pupil, Origen, was a noted advocate
of Universal Salvation. He says: “We assert
that the Word who is the wisdom of God, shall bring
together <em>all intelligent creatures</em>, and convert them
into his own perfection, through the instrumentalities<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
of their free-will and their own exertions. And the
consummation of all things will be the extinction <em>of
sin</em>; but whether it shall then be so abolished as
never to revive again in the universe does not belong
to the present discourse to show. What relates, however,
to the entire abolition of sin and the <em>reformation
of every soul</em>, may be obscurely traced in many
of the prophecies; for there we discover that the
name of God is to be invoked by all, so that <em>all</em> shall
serve him with one consent, that the reproach of contumely
is to be taken away, and that there is to be <em>no
more sin</em>, nor vain words, nor treacherous tongue.
This may not indeed take place with mankind in the
present life, but be accomplished after they shall have
been liberated from the body.”</p>

<p>A century later, Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, advocated
the same faith in the plainest terms: “What
therefore is the scope of St. Paul’s dissertation in this
place? That the nature of evil shall at last be <em>wholly
exterminated</em>, and divine, immortal goodness embrace
within itself <em>every rational creature</em>; so that of <em>all</em>
who were made by God, <em>not one</em> shall be excluded
from his kingdom.”</p>

<p>Diodorus, Bishop of Tarsus, in Silicia, A.D. 378,
was of that faith. “The wicked,” he says, “are to
suffer, not eternal torment, but a punishment proportioned
in length to the amount of their guilt; after
which, they are to be happy without end.” About
the same time, lived Fabius Manus Victorinus. He
maintained, that “Christ will regenerate all things;
through him all things will be purged, and return to
eternal life.”</p>

<p>Other learned, good, and influential men in those
early days, believed in and taught this truth. I will
name Titus, Bishop of Bostia; Basil the Great, Bishop
of Cæsarea; Didymus the Blind, and the learned
and powerful Jerome. In fact, most of the Christians,
Orthodox and anti-Orthodox, in the first age of<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
the Christian Era, entertained this faith. The writers
of those times speak of this faith as if it was not
questioned; they offer no labored argument in its
defence, and when they do refer to it, it is only incidentally.
But darkness was rapidly covering the
earth, and gross darkness the people. The enlightened
and benevolent doctrine of the Restitution was not
adapted to the savagism of the dark ages that was
then threatening the world, and so in the year of our
Lord 553, at Constantinople, by the Fifth Ecumenical
Council, it was condemned. From that period till
the Reformation of the fourteenth century, the religions
of the world corresponded with the ignorance and
brutality that prevailed. Our wise, benevolent, and
pure faith, not harmonizing with the savagism of the
times, had but few adherents. But in the great religious
awakening of the fourteenth century, it was
again entertained, and has been ever since gradually
gaining in favor.</p>

<p>In A.D. 1650, Gerard Winstonley, an Englishman,
in a book called, “Mystery of God,” thus writes,
“The whole creation of mankind shall be delivered
from corruption, bondage, death, and pain.” He was
persecuted for his faith, and thrown into prison. At
the same time lived and labored William Earbury, an
eminent preacher among the Independents. He was
a defender of the same faith. He asked, “What gospel,
what glad tidings is it to tell the world, that none
can be saved but the elect and believers? Christ
came to save only the <em>lost</em>, giving the word of life to
<em>all men</em>, that they might believe, a shutting all up in
unbelief, that he might have mercy on <em>all</em>.” “For the
ministry of God shall be finished, fully known, and
the angel swears by God, that time shall be no more;
for <em>all</em> shall be taken up into eternity, unto God himself,
and God shall be <em>all in all</em>.” (<cite>Terror of Tythes</cite>,
pages 175, 244.)</p>

<p>Another noble defender of the Restitution in those<span class="pagenum">[329]</span>
times, was Richard Coppin. He was charged with
blasphemy for believing in Universal Salvation, and
he replied, “Whatever is the will of God is not blasphemy
to affirm. The will of God is the salvation of
all men, therefore to say that <em>all men shall be saved</em> is
not blasphemy.” (<cite>Truth’s Triumph</cite>, page 7.) He
confounded his opposers in discussion, and that so enraged
them, they had him imprisoned. This took
place in 1656. At this time a book by an unknown
author appeared, with this title: “Of the Torments
of Hell; The Foundation; And the Pillars Thereof
Discovered, Searched, Shaken and Ruined. With
infallible proof that there is not to be punishment for
the wicked after this life; for any to endure that shall
not end.” The author was certainly a man of ability,
and much reading. He gives Orthodoxy some
pretty hard hits. This was written over two hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>At the same time lived Jeremy White, a chaplain
to Protector Cromwell. He published a book called,
“The Restitution of All Things: or, a vindication of
the goodness and grace of God, to be manifested at
last in the recovery of the whole creation out of their
fall.” He was truly a christian man; his soul was
imbued with the spirit of his faith. Dr. Thomas Burnet
of that age, was of like faith, and Lord Macauley,
in his “History of England,” says he was a “clergyman
of eminent genius, learning and virtue.” In
one of his works he writes, “I know not by what
means it happens at present, that some divines of a
cruel and fiery temper are extremely pleased with
eternal and infinite punishment, and can hardly endure
to have the point fairly examined and debated
on both sides.” There are some of that kind in the
world now.</p>

<p>William Whiston, the well known translator of Josephus,
was an unbeliever in endless misery. He
wrote a book entitled, “The Eternity of Hell Torments<span class="pagenum">[330]</span>
Considered.” Archbishop Hare says, he was
“a fair, unblemished character; all his life he cultivated
piety, virtue and good bearing.” He succeeded
Sir Isaac Newton as Professor of Mathematics, at
Cambridge. In his book he offers some cogent arguments
against eternal woe, but I have not time to state
them on this occasion. R. Roach, another English
clergyman, who flourished over an hundred years ago,
say, “Then will the general redemption be accomplished,
and the mediating office of the great High
Priest be at an end, for he will then deliver up the
kingdom thus completed to his Father, that ‘God may
be <em>all in all</em>.’” Bishop Warburton, the celebrated
author of the “Divine Legation of Moses,” had no
faith in ceaseless woe. He justly calls the preachers
of that doctrine, “unmerciful doctors,” “merciless
doctors.”</p>

<p>But I have not time to cite any more English testimony,
that the doctrines of the Restitution have been
long entertained by many of the purest, best, and
most learned of that nation. I will cross over into
Germany, and see if these sentiments have not been
entertained in that enlightened land.</p>

<p>As early as 1590, Samuel Huber, Professor of Divinity,
in Wittemburg, was a believer in the Restitution,
according to Spauheim, Professor of Divinity at
Geneva: “We think,” says the latter, “the opinion
of Huber on this subject absurd, who about the close
of the last century, began to publish and defend a
universal election of all men in Christ to salvation.”
At the same early day our righteous faith had a talented,
learned and pious advocate in John William
Petersen. He was Professor of Poetry at Rostock, in
1677. He was also superintendent at Lubic and
Lunenburg, and court preacher at Lutin. In 1700, he
published a work in three volumes, in defense of the
Restitution, which was extensively read, and caused
much excitement in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[331]</span></p>

<p>At the same time was published a book which has
been widely circulated and extensively read. It is
entitled, “The Everlasting Gospel,” by Paul Seigvolk.
It clearly and forcibly advocates the salvation
of mankind. It was very popular in Germany, and
has been republished at various times in different
parts of Europe. It was also published in this country
as early as 1753. That our divine faith was widely
diffused in those days, we learn from many other
sources. In the <cite>Analytical Review</cite>, an English periodical
published in 1780, we find the following:</p>

<p>“The doctrine of the final happiness of mankind,
which present the prospect of the termination of all
evil, and of a period in which the deep shades of misery
and guilt, which have so long enveloped the universe,
shall be forever dispelled, is so pleasing a speculation
to a benevolent mind, that we do not wonder
it meets with so <em>many</em> advocates. From the <em>earliest</em>
period, we doubt not the belief of it has been secretly
entertained by many, who, in the face of opposition
and danger, had not the resolution to avow it. Now,
however, it has broken through <em>every</em> restriction, and
walks abroad in every form that is adapted to convince
the philosophic, to arouse the unthinking, and
to melt the tender.”</p>

<p>These books, and others of like character, were
extensively circulated in Germany, and called the
attention of the public to the benevolent faith advocated
with so much learning and piety. An exciting
controversy was the result; and learned men on both
sides put forth all their strength for and against this
controverted doctrine.</p>

<p>But I have not time to say more about the history
of Universalism in Germany. Ever since the Reformation,
that faith has been gaining adherents, and at
the present time, it is almost universally entertained
by the Protestants of that country. Says Dr. Dwight,
in “Travels in North Germany,” “The doctrine of<span class="pagenum">[332]</span>
endless punishment is almost universally rejected. I
have seen but one person who believed it.” Not only
in Germany and England, but in Holland, Switzerland,
France, Scotland, and in other parts of Europe,
the doctrine of Universal Salvation prevailed at an
early day, and at the present time is widely diffused.
It exists more or less in all the Protestant denominations.
There is no sect in Europe called Universalist,
but the sentiment is found in all sects, and encounters
very little opposition.</p>

<p>I also spent three weeks in the north part of Iowa.
Lectured in Lyons, Marshalltown, Newton, Iowa City,
Washington, and in many other places. T. C. Eaton,
who resides in Des Moines, has labored very successfully
in the interior of that state. He has long been
in the West—has resided in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
as well as in Iowa—and wherever he has lived, has
always been a faithful laborer in the Master’s vineyard.
J. P. Sanford, is in Marshalltown, and is an
eloquent speaker, and laborious worker. Some fifteen
years since, I was introduced to him in Bentonsport,
Iowa. He was then a Methodist, and asked many
questions concerning the liberal faith. Six months
afterward he commenced preaching, and has been in
the ministry ever since. He was in the army two
years during the late rebellion, and was captain, colonel,
chaplain. He has traveled some in Europe, and,
it is said, delivers some interesting lectures concerning
“the old country.” He is also a noted masonic lecturer.
In Newton met A. C. Edmonds, who resides
and preaches in the place. He has spent several years
in California and Oregon, traveling and preaching; has
also published a denominational paper in those states.
Our people have a meeting-house, also a society, in
Newton. In Iowa City, the Universalists own a
church edifice, and J. Kinney is pastor of the society.
He is an excellent man, and the good cause prospers
under his ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[333]</span></p>

<p>I have labored in Iowa, more or less, most every
year, for a long time, and until lately my journeys
were made on horseback. In this way I have traveled
over about two thirds of the state. Iowa abounds
in good soil, and will, in a few years, be a rich and
populous country. Now is the time to establish our
beautiful faith in that young and vigorous state. It
will improve the people spiritually and morally, while
they are making themselves pleasant homes, and developing
the resources of the land. Said a man to
me in Marshalltown:</p>

<p>“Do you think the assassin Booth can be saved?”</p>

<p>“Jesus said, ‘I came to seek and save the lost.’
‘They that are whole need not a physician, but they
that are sick.’ And the apostle Paul teaches, that
Christ came to save the chief of sinners. As it was
the mission of our Savior to save the lost, the morally
sick, the chief of sinners, I dare not say, that even
Booth cannot be saved. But if Orthodoxy is true, I
had rather have Booth’s chances for heaven than Mr.
Lincoln’s. The latter received his death wound without
a moment’s warning, and was not conscious an
instant after the fatal bullet struck his head. He belonged
to no church, was not a professor of religion;
and so according to Orthodoxy, died impenitent, unregenerated,
a sinner, and must be lost eternally. But
Booth lived one or two hours after he was wounded,
and was perfectly conscious to the last moment of his
life. And who knows but he repented of his great
crime before he expired? And if he did, according to
Orthodoxy, he went straight to heaven. But if there
is any truth in Orthodoxy, Mr. Lincoln had no chance
whatever, for he died ‘impenitent.’ If Partialism is
true, as a general rule, murderers are saved, while
the murdered are lost, for in nine cases of every ten,
the latter, being killed suddenly, without any intimation
of their doom, and so have not time to say
‘Lord save me,’ are eternally lost; while the former,<span class="pagenum">[334]</span>
the murderers, having timely warning of their fate,
and special effort being made for their regeneration,
almost invariably swing from the gallows soundly
converted, and so go from the gibbet to immortal
glory. It takes Orthodoxy to translate the bloody
criminal into a saint, and fit him for heaven between
his monstrous crime and the halter; but Universalism
is required to save the murdered, the victim of
his iniquity. While I was residing in St. Louis, a
wretch by the name of Lamb, held with his own
hands, his young and confiding wife in the Mississippi
river, till she was dead. He was arrested, confessed
his guilt, and was hung; and on the gallows said, ‘I
have a hope within me that bears me up—a hope
that I shall live with God, and be happy with him,
and that I shall sing his praise. I die with a trust in
God.’ And Dr. Anderson, a Presbyterian, his spiritual
adviser, published in the papers that he was ‘satisfied
of the reality of Lamb’s penitence.’ Behold
the abominations of Orthodoxy! That woman belonged
to no church, had not ‘got religion,’ and so was
banished from the murderer’s hands to the devil, to
be the victim of his diabolical cruelty eternally. But
the incarnate fiend, whom the law called her husband,
was transported a few months afterward, from the
gallows to the third heaven, according to Orthodoxy.”</p>

<p>In one of my sermons in Washington, I spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>As man is susceptible of physical improvement, is
he not also of intellectual and moral? Cannot the
soul develop, grow, as well as the body? What a
vast difference there is between the infant mind and
that mind which has devoted years to intellectual and
moral culture? The soul is a germ; and as the germ
in the seed, under favorable circumstances, will bud,
blossom, and yield a rich harvest, so this spiritual
germ, if no obstructions interdict, will develop its
heavenly proportions to perfect manhood. The race,<span class="pagenum">[335]</span>
like each individual, has its childhood, its youth, and
perfect manhood. One individual is a representative
of the race. As one progresses the rest may. Suppose
every human being who walks the earth for five
hundred years, should make intellectual and moral
improvement, the great end and aim of his life, all
other pursuits subordinate to that one, what would be
the consequence? Would not Americans and Europeans,
at the expiration of that time, be as far in
advance of their present condition as they are now in
advance of the New Hollanders, Hottentots, and
inhabitants of the South Sea Islands? Undoubtedly
they would. The whole race would then be in the
kingdom of God. Sin would no longer be nurtured
on earth. There would be no soil for it to grow in.
The long hoped for, and prayed for, Millenium
would be ushered in—all would know the Lord from
the least to the greatest—the lion and the lamb
would lie down together. This glorious era is predicted
by Holy Writ, and God’s elder Scriptures.
Revelation and nature unite in testifying that mankind,
God’s noblest and best work, and for whom the
universe was made, are susceptible of infinite improvement,
that they will shine brighter and brighter
to the perfect day.</p>

<p>It may require more than five centuries to produce
such results; it probably will; but eternity is before
us. Our race is in its dawn only. The morning
twilight has just appeared. The darkness of barbarism
still lingers in the horizon. The chains of intellectual
and moral despotism are still clanking in
our midst. But the race, as well as the individual,
will reach noon-day. The sun of righteousness will
mount the zenith, and disperse all darkness and melt
all chains. Such characters as Moses, Homer, Plato,
Lord Bacon, Shakspeare, Newton, Napoleon, Franklin,
Washington, Jefferson, Clay, Webster, Beecher,
Chapin, and a multitude of others in <span class="allsmcap">INTELLECT</span>; and<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
such as Socrates, St. John, St. Paul, Melancthon, Howard,
Channing, Oberlin, Speer, and others too numerous
to mention, in <span class="allsmcap">MORAL WORTH</span>, indicate the intellectual
and moral heights all may ultimately attain.
They stand out in bold relief from the mass of mankind,
indicating the capabilities of human nature.
They are pioneers in the intellectual and moral field,
and the ground they occupy will ere long be occupied
by all. They are beacons on the rushing stream of
life to pilot humanity into the celestial haven.</p>

<p>The history of the earth and all therein and thereon,
as revealed by science and history, illustrates the law
of progress. This earth has been a theater of life for
innumerable ages—how long it is not for us to know.
Many of the remains of the old world are embedded in
the crust of the earth; and from them we learn, that
from the first appearance of life in the vegetable form,
up to man, there has been a regular progressive development.
The order seems to have been about thus:
1. Gross matter; 2. Mineral; 3. Marine Plants; 4.
Fish; 5. Reptiles; 6. Birds; 7. Marsupial; 8. Mamalia;
9. <span class="smcap">Man</span>, the flower, the crown, the lord of creation.
All these classes are interlinked, one hand
reaching up, and the other down, and all are ascending
in the line of the spiral, up to man. Every succeeding
class is superior to the preceding, from the
first to the last, and each class is moving onward.
The last type of the vegetable kingdom is infinitely
superior to the first, and so of all the other classes.
And man of the sixtieth century is far superior to
man of the first century. No miracle was wrought
in bringing any of these species into existence. No
law of nature was violated, or suspended; but all,
from the lowest grade up to man, were brought on to
the stage of life according to perfect and immutable
laws, emenating from the great Fountain of the Universe.</p>

<p>Mankind in their infancy were ignorant creatures;<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
as much below the Indians of the Rocky Mountains,
intellectually and morally, as they are below us.
They wandered, naked, in clans, like the Indians of
the West, subsisting on fish, reptiles, and such animals
as they could kill with their simple weapons, and on
the spontaneous fruit of the earth, without shelter by
night, or protection from the burning sun or pelting
storm.</p>

<p>Many centuries after this period, about the time the
city of Babylon was founded, although great advancement
had been made, yet the mass of the people were
as ignorant as are the aborigines of America. There
were a few highly developed minds, but the great
body of the people were enveloped in mental darkness,
of which we can form but faint conception—fit
materials for tyrants and leaders to make machines
of, and they freely used them for such sacrilegious
purposes. They were subject to their leader’s will;
were his bone and sinew; his battle axe and shield.
He was the head, they the body. At his will they
suffered and toiled, lived and died, and when their
oppressors’ earthly career closed, they erected pyramids
to perpetuate his fame and their degradation.
No effort was made to enlighten and moralize the
mass of mankind, for their masters well knew that
ignorant men made the best tools. No advancement
would have been made under such unfavorable circumstances
had not growth been natural to man.</p>

<p>If we trace the history of mankind during the rise
and progress of the Chaldean, Babylonian, Persian and
Roman empires, up to the time Christ was on earth,
we find, that although ignorance and degradation are
prominent features of the civilization of those times,
yet our hearts are made glad with clear evidence of
human progress. Every subsequent generation was
wiser and better than the previous one. True, the
advancing tide was slow, the current sluggish; sometimes
obstacles would arrest its progress, and even<span class="pagenum">[338]</span>
force it back toward its source, but nature would then
redouble her efforts, and sweep away all obstacles, and
press forward with her immortal freight to sunnier
skies and fairer climes.</p>

<p>When the Christian Era opened, it was the golden
age of antiquity. The purity of our Savior’s life, his
deep and fervent love for mankind, the beauty and
life-giving energy of the precepts and truths he uttered,
together with the goodness, zeal and extensive
labors and sufferings of his apostles and their associates,
gave the human mind an impetus it had not before
known.</p>

<p>The apostles and their coadjutors traversed the Roman
empire, which embraced most of the known
world, and denounced Paganism, and every species of
immorality, and called on the nations of the earth to
worship the one living and true God, who made and
governs the universe. They proclaimed, in obedience
to their divine Master, that God was the <span class="smcap">Father of
all mankind</span>; that the latter compose one great
<span class="allsmcap">BROTHERHOOD</span>, and are destined for <span class="allsmcap">IMMORTALITY</span>, <span class="allsmcap">PROGRESSION</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">HAPPINESS</span>; and from these cardinal
truths they drew these inferences, and enforced them
with holy life and eloquent speech—that men should
exercise brotherly kindness, general benevolence and
charity, and aid each other in traveling the heavenly
road.</p>

<p>Those holy men did not labor in vain. The human
soul was quickened into higher life by the germinating
power of truth; and had the gospel been retained
in its purity, and had the social and political condition
of mankind been in a higher sphere of development,
and had those favorable conditions continued to the
present time, long ago the Millenium would have
been ushered in. But the gospel was corrupted; the
social and political condition of mankind, although in
advance of any previous period, was in a deplorable
state. The Roman heart was rotten, the Roman<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
empire was corrupt, and before Christianity was proclaimed
in it to much extent, the empire was tottering
on its throne, and shaking from center to circumference;
and these precursors of still greater evils
filled the world with terror and confusion. The Pope
supplanted Christ, and Catholicism, Christianity; and
the Roman empire, by political earthquakes, was
shaking on its sandy foundation. And to add to the
terrors and disasters of the times, floods of barbarians
came rushing from the north, and the Saracens from
the east, like the lava from Vesuvius, that overwhelmed
Herculaneum and Pompeii, and buried the
empire and civilization beneath the flood, and almost
extinguished the light and life of Christianity. Those
were the darkest days the world had seen for many a
century.</p>

<p>Human progress then received a check from which
it was a long time in recovering; but the innate tendency
of human nature to move onward finally overcame
the mountains that human folly had thrown in
its way, and after the lapse of several centuries it
emerged into the light of science and religion.</p>

<p>The morning twilight which succeeded that long
night of anarchy, priestly rule and superstition, dawned
on the world in the fourteenth century. Intellect,
which had slumbered for ages, began to throw off its
lethargy. Universities sprang up in Europe. Science,
literature and religion began to be studied. Old
theories were looked into and questioned; and then
the martyr’s fires were rekindled by the conservatives
of that age; for every age has a class who love to
stand up to their ears in mud at their old landmarks,
and threaten all with temporal ruin or eternal damnation,
or both, who make an effort to get out of the
filth into the pure air and sunshine of heaven. This
old hunkerism I abhor, whether in church, state, or
literature. It would repress the energies of the world.
Our motto should be—go where the stream of truth<span class="pagenum">[340]</span>
bears us, regardless of consequences; they should not
be feared. Error and ignorance only are real and
fearful enemies.</p>

<p>Those early pioneers in the domain of truth, paid
dear for their independence and wisdom; many of
whom were burned at the stake or incarcerated in
dungeons. But the truths they uttered were not so
easily forced out of the world. A pious poet of those
times, speaking of the disinterment and scattering of
Wickliffe’s ashes on the Avon, utters this prophetic
language:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Avon to the Severn runs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The Severn to the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And Wickliffe’s ashes shall be strewn</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Wide as the waters be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The martyrs of truth fertilize our soil. The fires that
consumed their bodies lighten our skies. The clanking
of their chains, and the groans they uttered, are
yet sounding in our ears, and inspire us with indignation
against despotism of every name and kind.
They did as much for human progress by suffering
and dying in its cause as they did by the pen, speech,
or holy life. Their tears and their blood form a river
which has been meandering through the heart of
humanity down to the present time; and all along its
margin, little rills have been pouring into it from the
hearts and eyes of those who have been persecuted
for righteousness’ sake. And the stream that was
once small has become large, and will increase every
day as it flows on, imparting vitality to the great
heart of humanity. Revere those great men. And
although they may not have known the whole truth,
yet they were far in advance of the age in which they
lived, were true friends of man, and we owe them a
lasting debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>And what shall I say of the present condition of
the enlightened nations of the earth? The truth is,<span class="pagenum">[341]</span>
never before did man attain the intellectual and moral
eminence he now enjoys; never before was the human
mind so active or making such rapid strides.
“The world is entering on a new moral cycle. The
great heart of humanity is heaving with hopes of a
still brighter day. The instincts of our nature prophesy
its approach, and the best intellects of our world
are struggling to turn that prophecy to fulfilment.
Thoughts of freedom, duty, benevolence, equality and
human brotherhood agitate the nations of the earth;
and neither the Pope with his Cardinals and Jesuits,
nor the kings with their ministers, can repress it.
Were these thoughts imprisoned in the center of the
earth, they would burst its granite folds, speed onward
in their career and fill their destiny. They are imbued
with a deathless vigor. They must prevail, or
the idea of a Moral Governor of the universe is impossible,
and the divine truths of the gospel a fable.”</p>

<p>Old ideas are being modified, or laid aside without
a memento to keep them in remembrance, and new
ones from the heavenly mint are taking their places.
The pruning-hook and plough-share are making sad
havoc of grey-bearded theories. But we must not for
a moment suppose that the worshipers of antiquated
institutions and ideas, will yield in this struggle without
a desperate effort to preserve their idols. And
no doubt the cry will be raised as of old, “Great is
Diana of the Ephesians;” and multitudes will shout,
“Crucify, crucify, all who are not of our party.”</p>

<p>All who have eyes must see that changes are taking
place every where. Men may shut their eyes and
prophesy that all things will continue as they are; but
as Galileo said of the earth, after renouncing his philosophy
to save his life: “<span class="smcap">It revolves still</span>;” so
whether we believe it or not, the human mind is outgrowing
and leaving old errors, which had their origin
in barbarism, and is advancing into the region of
truth and reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[342]</span></p>

<p>But the old heavens and earth will not pass away
without great noise—not until the elements shall be
melted with fervent heat, by the Sun of righteousness.
The nations of the earth have long fought with
steel and bullet, but now the great battle of ideas is
being fought. The old and the new, the past and the
present, the kingdom of God and the kingdom of
satan, have entered the list; and as sure as the rising
sun dispels the darkness, chill, and dampness of night,
as sure as day succeeds night, will truth triumph over
error in this conflict. The hay, wood and stubble
will be consumed, but the silver and gold will pass
the fiery ordeal.</p>

<p>Had some conversation with a Spiritualist. The
Bible, in his estimation, is full of lies and absurdities,
as unreliable in its religious instruction as an almanac
in its weather prognostics. But all Spiritualists do
not go to that extreme; many of them entertain sincere
respect for that book, and love to cultivate the
religious sentiment. I have a great deal of faith in
that kind of Spiritualism. The old prophets, Christ
and his apostles, and multitudes of the wise and good
in all ages, have been Spiritualists of that character.
Such kind of Spiritualism is only another name for
Christianity. But with the irreverent and ungodly
sort of Spiritualism, I have no sympathy. I believe it
to be blasting and damning in its influence, and will
ultimately land its believers in rank Atheism. It has
already made shipwreck of many a man and woman,
and its dreadful work in that direction will fearfully
increase unless there should be a return to reason.</p>

<p>I attended a revival meeting while on this journey,
and witnessed some extraordinary doings. There
was shouting, ranting, screaming, jumping, crying
and laughing. The preacher told us, that the lowest
and vilest could be instantly translated into saints. I
remembered the old song I had heard on such occasions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[343]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come dirty, come filthy, come ragged, come bare:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">You can’t come too filthy—come just as you are.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The preacher did not intend to promote immorality,
but no doubt this telling people, that unwashed scoundrels
at the end of a long life in every crime can be
instantly transformed into saints of the first water,
and so escape all punishment for a misspent life, has
a very immoral influence. A hardened sinner may
to-day right-about face, and resolve to travel upward
hereafter, but he has a long journey before him. But
if he pursues it, he will finally reach the heavenly
city, and walk its golden streets.</p>

<p>A man at the meeting asked me if a person could
be “saved without repentance and regeneration?” I
replied:</p>

<p>“You might as well ask if a man can see without
eyes, hear without ears, think without a head, talk
without a tongue, or walk without legs. You misunderstand
salvation. It is not from an outward hell,
but from ignorance, error, sin, and all their debasing
effects. He who has thoroughly repented, or reformed,
which is the same thing, <em>is</em> saved, not will be; a
regenerated soul <em>is</em> saved, not will be saved at some
future period, and in some other world. Repentance
and regeneration sweep and garnish the soul, make
it a fit habitation for the heavenly guest—salvation.
Jesus said, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of God is at
hand.’ It is always ‘at hand,’ ready to be established
in every reformed, regenerated heart.”</p>

<p>Said another, “If Universalism is true, what is the
use of preaching?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir,” I answered, “preaching is
one means by which salvation is effected. God works
by means. By means of the sun he lightens and
warms the earth; by means of the rain he cools and
purifies the atmosphere, fertilizes the soil, and fills our
fountains with living water. By means of natural<span class="pagenum">[344]</span>
laws he controls every globe, and every particle of
matter in the universe. So, by wise and righteous
instrumentalities, he blesses man spiritually, and will
continue to bless him forever and ever. And the
proclamation of truth and righteousness, through the
christian ministry, is one means appointed by heaven
to this blessed end. Eighteen hundred years ago
Jesus said, ‘Know the truth, and the truth shall make
you free;’ and he consecrated men, and commissioned
them, to ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel
to every creature.’ It is freedom <em>now</em> that we need;
it is salvation <em>now</em>, that the proclamation of the truth
produces. As the presence of Jesus brought salvation
into Zaccheus’ house, so the preaching of the gospel
brings a present salvation to the soul. Give up
the wretched delusion, that the chief end of preaching
is to save us from a hell beyond the grave. It is for
no such a purpose. Its object is to enlighten and purify
man <em>now</em>, that he may be happy in this world.”</p>

<p>In Kimball, I delivered a discourse; and at its
close a Methodist minister told the congregation that
he, heart and soul, believed in the “Restitution of all
things;” and that he would not part with that faith
for the world. He said it was the joy of his life; it
made him a better man; it prepared him to live, and
he trusted that it would be his stay and his hope in
the hour of death.</p>

<p>I stopped in Moline, Ill., and delivered one discourse.
This is a manufacturing place, at the head
of Rock Island, and exhibits much thrift and enterprise.
Said a man to me in the town:</p>

<p>“The Bible says, no self-murderer shall enter the
kingdom of God. What do you do with that passage?”</p>

<p>“That is home-made scripture,” I replied; “there
is nothing of the kind in the Bible. Besides, there
never was, and never will be, a self-murderer. To
murder is to ‘kill <em>with malice aforethought</em>.’ A man<span class="pagenum">[345]</span>
may commit suicide, but that is not murder, for he
does not do it with malignity or malice toward himself.
For the poor suicide I have much sympathy.
Who can estimate the agony he suffered, to escape
which, he took his own life? Have charity for such
a poor unfortunate; speak not harshly of him; condemn
him not. Jesus would weep over his grave,
and say, ‘Father, forgive him.’ The apostle John
says, ‘Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer, and
ye know, that no murderer hath eternal life abiding
in him.’ 1 John iii. 15. This speaks of the <em>present
condition</em> of the murderer—not his everlasting condition.
No murderer <em>hath</em> eternal life <em>abiding in him</em>.
Of course he has not, or he would not be a murderer.
Eternal life is Christ-life, heaven-life; a life of love to
God, and good will toward man. A murderer is selfish,
cruel, bloody, revengeful. A murderous character,
and a christian character, cannot exist in one soul.
But the murderer may reform. Paul was a persecutor,
assisted in murdering Stephen of blessed memory,
but he reformed. Jesus on the cross prayed God
to forgive his murderers.”</p>

<p>“But then suppose he dies a murderer, what will
become of him?”</p>

<p>“If the murderer can reform before he dies, why
not after he dies? Does reason, wisdom, goodness,
the Bible say, that if a man leaves this world a sinner,
he will be compelled to be a sinner eternally?
That is an assumption of Orthodoxy; but it never
was proved, and never will be. Why does the Bible
say, ‘God will have all men to be saved,’ if it is his
purpose that all who leave this world sinners never
shall be saved? Why does he call on all to repent, if
he intends, that all who die impenitent never shall
reform? It is a dreadful thing to live or die a murderer;
but the mercy of God can save him in this
world, and that same mercy can save him in the
future world.”</p>

<p>My last long campaign was in Missouri and Illinois.
Left Chicago, accompanied by Mrs. Manford,
Tuesday night, September 16, 1866, and by sunrise
the next morning we were in Galesburg, Ill., one hundred
and sixty miles southward. The United States
Convention of Universalists was holding its annual
session in that place, and we tarried till its close.
Met many clergymen from the East and West I had
not before seen; and had the satisfaction of shaking
hands with W. S. Balch, with whom I studied many
years before, but had not beheld his face since I left
his sanctum in Claremont, N. H., to come West. He
is now pastor of the Universalist society in Galesburg.
Years have changed the outer man, somewhat, but
the inner man seems to be as vigorous, generous and
brotherly as ever. Brother Balch has noble qualities
of head and heart; and he has ever been faithful and
successful in his high calling.</p>

<p>The Lombard University is located in Galesburg;
and although “University” is rather a big name for
such an institution—the West is fond of high sounding
names—it is an excellent school, and is doing a
great work. It combines an academy and college; its
doors are open to both sexes, they having equal privileges.
This is as it should be. The old custom of
educating girls and boys apart is all wrong. They<span class="pagenum">[347]</span>
learn faster together than if educated separately. A
healthy rivalry is induced, each sex being anxious to
secure the approbation of the other; besides, associating
together, not less in the school-room than at home
tends to refine and invigorate both sexes. The property
of this institution is one hundred thousand dollars,
and about as much more has recently been subscribed
for its benefit. It is destined to exert a vast
influence in the West in favor of liberal principles.</p>

<p>The denomination has several other excellent institutions
of learning in the United States. There is
Tufts College, located in Medford, Mass., four miles
from Boston. Its funds and real estate are worth
eight hundred and five thousand dollars. It has a
library embracing ten thousand volumes. In Canton,
N. Y., we have two schools—the St. Lawrence University,
and Theological School. The University has
property worth one hundred and four thousand dollars.
We also have an academy in Clinton, N. Y.,
called the Clinton Liberal Institute. It has property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars. We likewise
have a school in Westbrook, Me., three miles from
Portland. It is one of the best institutions in the
state, and its permanent fund is thirty thousand dollars.
The Green Mountain Institute is located in
Woodstock, Vt. A fine farm is connected with the
school, and the average attendance is about one hundred.
In Glover, Vt., the Orleans Liberal Institute
is located. From seventy to one hundred pupils
attend it, and its friends intend to increase its usefulness.</p>

<p>There are three other educational institutions being
established by the denomination. One in Jefferson,
Wis. It has so far progressed, that one term has been
held. A fine academy building will soon be erected.
In Barre, sixteen miles from Montpelier, the capital
of Vermont, our brethren are establishing a school.
Fifty thousand dollars have already been subscribed.<span class="pagenum">[348]</span>
In Franklin, Mass., a first class academy will soon be
in operation. Dr. Dean, its founder, donated sixty
thousand dollars, and the trustees have raised forty
thousand more. A magnificent building is nearly
finished on a beautiful site, with ample grounds.</p>

<p>This is a pretty fair record for so young a denomination
as ours; and all this has been accomplished in
about thirty-five years. But our work is only fairly
begun in the educational field. More schools must be
established; and those already in operation must be
strengthened, and their usefulness increased. Proper
education improves the head and the heart, and qualifies
us to act with dignity and success our part on the
stage of life.</p>

<p>September 20th. Mrs. Manford returned to Chicago,
and at 5 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, I took cars for Quincy, one
hundred miles south; and the next morning was
steaming across the Missouri prairies to Macon City,
sixty miles west of the great river. Most of the country
is prairie, high, dry and rolling, with good soil,
but thinly settled. Saw large herds of cattle, horses,
mules and sheep, feeding on the vast savannas. Lectured
in Macon City. A good congregation would
immediately be gathered here, if a minister could be
obtained. Two lawyers, especially, expressed much
anxiety for such an arrangement. Macon is at the
crossing of the Hannibal and St. Joseph, and North
Missouri railroads, and is bound to be an important
town.</p>

<p>September 22d. Rode to Brookfield, forty miles
west. Crossed the dividing ridge between the Mississippi
and Missouri rivers, two of the great rivers of
the world. Most of the country is hilly, timber is
plenty, and the soil middling. Brookfield is exactly
midway between the two rivers. The railroad company
has its machine shops here, and the town is in a
flourishing condition. The country around is beautiful
and productive. It is a charming locality for a<span class="pagenum">[349]</span>
home. Rode into the country the next day, Sunday,
eight miles, and talked to the people; returned in the
afternoon, and lectured to a fair congregation.</p>

<p>September 25th. Proceeded to Chillicothe, forty
miles toward the setting sun, and delivered my message.
This is a fine town, and improving rapidly.
We ought to have a church here, and could soon have
one if proper effort was made. We always have large
congregations here. I. M. Westfall, several years
since, had a discussion in this place with a Methodist
minister, and he made the dry bones shake.</p>

<p>September 27th. Journeyed to St. Joseph, about
seventy miles. This is the largest town in North
Missouri. It is located on the east bank of the Missouri
river; has quite a city appearance; the streets
are paved, and the business houses are chiefly brick,
and of a substantial character. This, and three other
towns within seventy-five miles, are striving for the
mastery—Kansas City, Leavenworth and Lawrence.
Time only will determine which will win. But there
is bound to be one large commercial center somewhere
in this region. Which of the four will be that city?
I refer to 1875 for an answer.</p>

<p>September 28th. Rode to Savannah, thirteen miles
northward, and lectured in the evening. R. K. Jones,
an active and enterprising man, preaches here monthly.
Expect to spend three weeks traveling where
there are no railroads; and as I have no conveyance
of my own, shall depend on a kind Providence, and
good friends for transportation.</p>

<p>September 29th. Rode horseback to Fillmore, ten
miles; a sprightly boy went with me to lead the
horse back; and on the next day, Sunday, was conveyed
by a friend, to Mound City, eighteen miles,
where I delivered a long discourse at eleven o’clock,
in a beautiful grove, and in the evening spoke in a
school-house, four miles distant.</p>

<p>October 1st. Rode a borrowed horse twelve miles,<span class="pagenum">[350]</span>
and lectured at night. Was sick two days from excessive
speaking. Met a woman who heard me in
Ohio twenty-five years ago. Am now sixty miles
above St. Joseph, on the Missouri river bottom. The
soil is as rich as was that of the far-famed valley of
Egypt. Most of the bottom is prairie, and the land
dry, warm and easily tilled. It is a charming region—beautiful
beyond description. A few miles west,
the Missouri bluffs in Kansas and Nebraska are visible.
Although barely able to sit on the horse, I rode
twelve miles.</p>

<p>October 4th. The ride did me good—am all right
again. Went in a buggy to Oregon, twelve miles,
and heard an excellent discourse by R. K. Jones.
About one year previous, I delivered three discourses
in this town, the first of the kind heard there, and
they caused considerable excitement; whereupon Mr.
Smith, a Presbyterian clergyman, proposed debating,
to which I consented. We settled the preliminaries;
but Mr. Smith’s ardor for the discussion soon abated,
and the subject was dropped. But another party is
now trying to get up a discussion with me, and they
are corresponding with Mr. Summerhill, of Cincinnati,
Ohio, a noted minister in his order, about engaging
in it.</p>

<p>October 5th. Went to Fillmore—rode part way,
and walked part way—and lectured in the evening.
A society will probably soon be organized here, as we
have a goodly number of friends within a few miles
of the place. At a previous visit to this town, a
preacher replied to my discourse. There were several
clergymen of different denominations present,
and they delegated this one to be spokesman. But
he yielded so much that his colleagues were disgusted
and said, “he might as well have proclaimed himself
a Universalist.”</p>

<p>October 7th. A friend conveyed me on Sunday
morning, to Whitesville, eighteen miles, where I<span class="pagenum">[351]</span>
spoke on that day twice. Here also a society could
be formed.</p>

<p>October 8th. A gentleman and lady took me in a
buggy to Rochester, sixteen miles, where I spoke to a
large congregation, but found only a few who sympathized
with me.</p>

<p>October 9th. A kind friend conveyed me to my
next appointment, in Maysville, twenty-five miles
eastward. He took his three boys with him, he said,
that they might see the country for they were all
recently from Ohio. Men and boys were delighted
with the country we passed over, as well they might
be, for it is a lovely land—high, rolling, rich prairie.
A large number attended the meeting. Probably not
a dozen present had before heard a discourse on the
Restitution. I hope some good seed was sown, and,
that it will germinate, bud, blossom, and yield a rich
harvest.</p>

<p>October 10th. Rode twenty-five miles to-day, and
preached at night, and the next day. These were the
first sermons on our faith ever heard in Gallatin. A
Congregationalist minister gave notice that he should
reply to them, two days subsequently. In a conversation
with him he remarked, that his denomination
were the “<em>liberals</em> of the evangelical school.” They
may be in the West, but they certainly are not in the
East. Their creed is cold, cruel, intolerant, Calvinism.
There is not a particle of liberality or generosity
in it. It is as rigid as iron bars, and cold as icebergs.</p>

<p>October 12th. Rode horseback sixteen miles, to
Bancroft, and lectured. Although our liberal faith
had not before been publicly taught here, I found
many friends. A large family by the name of Hendricks,
all formerly Dunkards, reside here, and they
are devoted believers in the Restitution. Most of that
denomination, I have met with, agree with us in the
final redemption of humanity, and they are generally<span class="pagenum">[352]</span>
truly christian people. Elhanan Winchester once
said, “If God has a people on earth, it is the Dunkards.”</p>

<p>October 13th. A friend took me to Trenton, eighteen
miles, where I delivered three sermons. They
were the first of the kind in the town, or county, and
large numbers attended. A preacher did his best to
keep the people away, but he was nearly deserted, for
the people were bound to hear the “new doctrine.”
I here met a man by the name of John Murray, who
said he was a distant relative of the sainted Rev. John
Murray. When I was in Iowa City recently, I found
a man by the name of Winchester, who is a relative
of Rev. Elhanan Winchester, of blessed memory.
They have good blood in their veins.</p>

<p>October 15th. Conveyed to Lindville, fifteen miles,
and preached at night. The people here had not before
heard one of our faith. Some believed, and some
disbelieved.</p>

<p>October 16th. Rode fourteen miles on horseback,
and walked six miles. Came to a stream where there
was no bridge, and pulling off boots and socks, waded
through, and passed on to fill my appointments. Lectured
twice in this place, Milan, to full houses.</p>

<p>October 18th. Went to Greencastle, fifteen miles,
and lectured twice. There is a small society in this
village, and two brother preachers are residing near
by—W. Brise and G. S. Ayers. It is to be hoped
they will hereafter devote more of their time to the
ministry.</p>

<p>October 20th. Lectured in Unionville twice, and
once in the neighborhood; and the next day was conveyed
by a friend to Lancaster, twenty miles still farther
onward, where I also spoke twice. The next day,
rode to Memphis, or rather rode and walked, twenty-five
miles, where I spoke twice, and once in the country.
From thence was conveyed by a friend to Bentonsport,
Iowa, where I took the cars and went home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[353]</span></p>

<p>I recently heard a discourse by one of our ministers,
and he gave Orthodoxy an awful cudgeling. I
do not like that kind of preaching. It is too much of
the meat-axe order. The christian minister should
preach the gospel in all its fulness—present it in its
doctrinal, moral, and spiritual aspect. But cutting,
slashing, and banging, at this creed, and that creed,
at this sect and that sect, is not exactly preaching the
gospel. It may be the minister’s duty, now and then,
under peculiar circumstances, to handle other creeds
without gloves; but let him remember and do his
duty in this respect in a loving spirit. But there
should be but little of this kind of controversial sermonizing.
Telling people of the beauty and glory
of truth and virtue, and urging a practical knowledge
of the same, is far better than to be fighting Orthodoxy.
It must be admitted, that some of the fathers
of our denomination, in this respect, have set a bad
example. They had too much of the Ishmaelite spirit,
and many of us have imbibed of it copiously.
True, they were assailed by slander and falsehood, in
private and in public, at home and abroad, when they
went in, and when they went out; and it required a
copious infusion of the Divine Spirit to be perfect
lambs under such circumstances. And our people in
the West and South, especially the ministers, are still
pursued with the same maliciousness, injustice and
cruelty, and it requires remarkable good nature to be
thus treated without striking back. But some of us
have rather overdone this matter of “using up” Orthodoxy.
Not, it is to be hoped, that we have been
actuated by the fiendish spirit of some of our enemies,
but we spend too much precious time, and waste
too much material, on their creeds. Better present
the truth in its native beauty and grace, and the
world will soon fall in love with it, and take it to it’s
heart.</p>

<p>I had been at home but a few days, when I was<span class="pagenum">[354]</span>
called to the southern part of Illinois, to deliver two
funeral discourses. One of them was on the occasion
of the death of Mrs. Middleworth, an estimable woman,
cut down in the vigor of womanhood, and in the
midst of usefulness. A large number attended the
service; some came as far as fifteen miles. Surely,
if ever we need consolation, it is when death enters
our abode, and snatches therefrom a dear friend. Sensitive
ties are then severed, and affection’s nerves receive
a dreadful shock. The death of a friend is like
an untimely frost on an orange grove; it may indeed
kill but one, but it blights the whole grove. But
death is no new thing under the sun. For six thousand
years mankind have been dying. It is estimated
that sixty persons die every minute. Every hour in
the day, week, month, year, century, thousands of
human beings breathe their last breath, and heave
their last sigh. All over the world are dying scenes,
and funeral scenes. An army of the living are employed
to bury an army of the dead. And this sad
work has been going on for sixty centuries.</p>

<p>How true are the words of the wise man: “One
generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.”
Death and the grave are never satisfied. The
high and the low, the old and the young, the saint
and the sinner, must alike be prostrated in death
when the king of terror hurls his unerring dart. As
ocean wave succeeds wave, so generation of men succeed
generation, and each in its turn is borne to, and
dashes and dies upon the fearful shore of time. Every
thing on earth speaks of mutation and death. The
lofty marble monument, erected to commemorate human
genius; the stately palace of wealth, pomp and
greatness, are being crumbled to dust by the busy and
untiring hand of time. Saith the Bible, “All flesh is
grass.” As the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth,
so with mortal man. The decree has gone forth
from the court of heaven, and cannot be revoked,<span class="pagenum">[355]</span>
“Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”
No appeal is admitted; no reversal of the judgment
need be expected. <em>Die we all must!</em> But how little
is this dreadful fact realized by many! How many
spend life as if they believed it would never end!
To the accumulation of earthly treasures, or the advancement
of ambitious schemes, multitudes devote
all their energy, all their talent, all their precious
time. Unwise men! God made us for more noble
pursuits; and he who devotes all of life’s blessed moments
to the accumulation of earth’s perishable treasures,
answers not to the end of his being, is not a
friend to himself, but rather his own greatest enemy.</p>

<p>But when the decrees of the Almighty shall be
executed; when dust shall have returned to dust, and
ashes to ashes, shall we be no more forever? Will
death never yield his prey? Shall we share the fate
of the beetle and the worm? Will the tender ties of
love and affection, which are severed by the cold hand
of death, with weeping eyes and bleeding heart, never
be reunited? And when we consign our dear friends
to the grave, shall we never more behold them? Never
more enjoy their society, which society made a
heaven of earth? And when we shall bid farewell
to earth, and close our eyes in death, shall we be annihilated?
Some there are, who answer these important
questions in the affirmative. Some there are,
who tell us, that death is an eternal sleep, that the
grave and the worm will devour our all; that we are
like the bubble on the wide ocean, seen for a moment,
and then disappear to be known no more forever.
But thank God, we have reason to hope for better
things. We have reason to hope that there is a life
beyond this life, a world beyond this world, where
friends will meet, where the great family of God will
meet, to part no more; that on the blissful plains of
immortality, the severed links of humanity will be
welded in an immortal chain, never more to be severed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[356]</span></p>

<p>While in the neighborhood where this service was
held, I delivered two other discourses, to great congregations.
From thence I went to Dudley, and delivered
another funeral discourse, on the occasion of the death
of Mrs. Sutherland, a devoted believer in our most
holy faith, and an excellent woman. It is sometimes
said by the opposers of the Great Salvation, that it is
good to live by, but not to die by. But it seems to
me, that what is good to live by, must be good to die
by, for what prepares us to live, prepares us to die.
When the opposer tells me, that my religion “is good
to live by,” I thank him for such testimony in its
favor; but I cannot return the compliment, cannot
admit that his creed, let it be what it may, if it denies
the essential features of the Restitution, “is good to
live by.” Is Atheism, which denies a God, and
orphanizes the world, “good to live by?” Is Deism,
that denies a Savior, and doubts an hereafter, “good
to live by?” Is Partialism, that represents God as
cruel, revengeful and unjust; as loving some and hating
others; blessing some and cursing others, world
without end, “good to live by?” Men can live with
such creeds in their heads, as they can live on horse
ham and mule stake; but it is living at a poor dying
rate.</p>

<p>But then, this faith so full of grace “is not good to
die by.” But why not? It represents God as a universal
Father, Christ a universal Savior, and heaven
the home to which all are tending. Is not faith in
such a God, such a Savior, and such a Destiny, good
in the hour of death? The truth is, nothing but this
can afford peace and consolation in that dark and solemn
hour. Atheism, Deism, Partialism, are found
wanting in man’s dying moments, as when in the possession
of health and vigor. True, many close their
eyes in death with blissful hopes, who do not accept
the faith of God’s Universal Grace, and for this reason—in
their dying hour they gaze entirely on the bright<span class="pagenum">[357]</span>
side of their creed, for it has a bright side as well as
a dark side. They think they can read their “title
clear to mansions in the skies,” hence depart in peace.
But if they looked for an instant on the dark side of
their faith; if they considered that they may be mistaken
with regard to their own salvation, and instead
of going to heaven may go to hell. And then, around
their dying couch are their near and dear friends;
and for aught they know, all of them in a few years
will be lifting up their eyes in eternal torment, and
begging for a drop of water to cool their flaming
tongues—if the dying deemed this possible, and it is
possible if Orthodoxy is true, would not the thought
turn joy into the bitterest sorrow, and songs of praise
into howls of despair? But the truth is adapted to
all stages and conditions of humanity. It is our counselor,
guide, and hope, in the strength and vigor of
manhood; our staff in sickness and old age; our <em>all</em>
when our eyes are closing in death, and the grave is
opening at our feet.</p>

<p>After speaking in five other places in the south part
of the state, I returned home; and had been there
but two days, when a telegraphic despatch summoned
me to attend the funeral of Mrs. Jameson, in Marshall
county, Ill., over one hundred miles distant.
When turning away from her grave, her husband
remarked: “There is buried one of the best women
that ever lived.” That is the best eulogy that can be
pronounced over the grave of the dead. The departed
suffered for months, by day and by night, the most
excruciating physical agony, but not a murmur dropped
from her lips. She knew that sickness was unto
death, and she welcomed the approach of the angel
of deliverance. A good life and a christian faith, are
blessed friends in the sunset of life. As I am writing
about the last page of this book, a letter, with a black
border, from a woman in Missouri is received, announcing
the death of her husband, and requesting<span class="pagenum">[358]</span>
me to attend his funeral. It was his desire, she
writes, that I should do so, and I must respect his
dying wish.</p>

<p>The common view of death, I am satisfied, is too
dark and gloomy. When we look upon the cold
and rigid form, the closed eyes and pale brow, of the
dead, a sense of gloom, and a vague feeling of fear
comes over us; but we should remember, that the
being that lately animated that now lifeless body, is a
resident of the “house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens.” But we are oppressed too much by
what we see, and have not faith enough in the reality
of a life in heaven. And hence it is, that in the
chamber of death, at the time of the Holy Passover,
bitter sobbings are heard, in the place of song of
rejoicing; and hence it is that the coffin, our second
cradle, is followed to the grave by those who are
arrayed in gloomy habiliments expressive of grief and
sorrow. To those who have passed into the house of
“many mansions,” death must appear in a very different
light. The two grand eras in our life below, its
beginning and its close, birth and death, must be viewed
by them as really beautiful and equally divine. The
departed know by experience what death is. They
have tasted the cup, and know that it contains, not a
poisonous draught, but the wine of life. They know
that this is a world of shadows, not the world above.</p>

<p>When the hour of death arrives, the couch of the
dying is surrounded by invisible friends, as by those
who still abide in the flesh; and one hand of the dying
is held by those to whom he is now to bid adieu;
and the other is taken by those whom the eye of flesh
can no longer see. “On the one side, there is weeping
and almost despair; on the other, the joyful hymn
of welcome. Surely tears are a relief to men in this
mortal state; and I would not even seem to say that
they are wrong. I say only this, that the occasion of
our most intense grief, would be no occasion of grief,<span class="pagenum">[359]</span>
were death understood by us as it is by those who
know by experience—by that holy experience—what
it is. Were we able to follow, with open eyes,
those who are dear to us, as they pass away, and see
them as they are in the Better Land, and know how
they are surrounded and employed, we should not
mourn as we now do when friends depart, nor should
we feel any temptation thus to mourn, and the fear of
death would be wholly unknown to us.”</p>

<p>This, I believe, to be the correct view of death;
and its general prevalence would dispel the gloom that
now hangs over the grave, and save the world many
tears and griefs. The day will come when the inhabitants
of the earth, having a proper estimate of death,
and the hereafter, will wonder that we regarded death
with the gloomy apprehension we do. When that
day blesses the world, there will be no more death, as
most of mankind now regard it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To conclude: I have innumerable reasons to be
grateful to Almighty God, that I have lived so long,
enjoyed almost uninterrupted good health, had so
many friends, and been permitted to labor in the gospel
ministry. Truly, the Lord has blessed me all the
days of my life. I have never had but two spells of
sickness, and they were induced by hard labor in hot
weather. Notwithstanding my extensive traveling, I
have never met with the slightest accident, and I
have journeyed by sea and land, in sailing vessels and
steamboats, on railroads and on horseback, in stages,
and in wagons of all descriptions. Have traveled in
dangerous localities by day and by night, but a penknife
is the largest weapon I ever carried. One more
personal remark—I never snuffed, chewed, or smoked
tobacco; neither did I ever poison my body or my
soul with a glass of liquor—do not know whisky from
brandy, and do not covet the knowledge.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
